I found somebody dumped tires in front of my house. (Probably the same gray truck I see driving around with a bed full of tires.)

I got labs done at the hospital and this time they didn't have to stab me three or four times, and my test numbers were good.

I went to Jeanfreau's on Paris Road for the first time. It wasn't bad.

Later Gina and I met her Cincinnati friends Brian and Chris and watched the Bengals (with Joe Burrow) beat the Jaguars.

Not every day is an adventure.
