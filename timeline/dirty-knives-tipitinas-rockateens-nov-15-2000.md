Another WTUL show arranged by Anthony Del Rosario. I wish I could remember it better. I had been friends with Ballard Lesemann, the R*A*T's drummer for a long time, ever since he woke me up by singing "In A Big Country" to me and my girlfriend in North Georgia some time before.

This was Talbot Adams's last show as a Dirty Knife.
