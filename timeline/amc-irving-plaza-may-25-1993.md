Thanks to American Music Club for having such [an exhaustive website](http://americanmusicclub.com/index.php/Gigography) that allowed me to cross-reference the date of this show. This appears to be their only show at Irving Plaza so I guess this is the right one.

I remember the guitarist or bassist had one of those ugly Steinberger axes that I disliked so much.

Here's a review by Peter Watrous:
