This was an insane show, with a band from Japan playing a New Year's Eve show in New Orleans, Louisiana. For an insane band, Ka-Nives were great organizers.

This is the only show I can think of where two of my bands played the same bill.

We had nothing to hold the kick drum in place so for a while I sat in front of it. (We took turns.)

Sorry, I do have pictures from this show, somewhere.
