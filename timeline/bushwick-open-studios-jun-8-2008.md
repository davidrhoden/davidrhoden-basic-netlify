I've got some pieces showing in Bushwick Open Studios this weekend. They're up on the roof at 100 Thames Street. the printed materials said my actual studio would be open; that's hard for me to do since I live there, and, currently, I have no work there (ok, three pieces). To those people I heard knocking on my door, what can I say? I'm sorry, thanks for coming by.

There's a lot of wonderful art happening in Bushwick from what I've seen, and I've barely scratched the surface.
