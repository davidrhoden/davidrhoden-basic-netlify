![The Stacks played a show in Dr. Cliff Davis' grage, Bernadotte Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.](/static/img/rock/stacks/stacks-dr-cliff-sep-4-2004.jpg)

I know we played Dr. Cliff's garage two times. Not 100% sure on this date.

We really are at our best as a garage band.

Dr. Cliff Davis's garage was at 426 S. Bernadotte Street New Orleans, Louisiana. I loved playing these shows. One time (this time) he or somebody brought a bunch of Barbies to burn. Another time Little Freddie King showed up and played for a bit. I once drank too much and fell asleep on Dr. Cliff's workbench, among the curly wood and metal shavings. Ah, youth.
