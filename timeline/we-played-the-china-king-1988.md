Our band Everything Tool played China King on the Cumberland Avenue strip a lot. It was a fun gig. If you got there early enough Mr. and Mrs. Liu would feed you a big family-syle dinner, though this wasn't always a good thing. Once they were handing out the egg rolls and they said "Take two! Take two!" I did, and on that occasion I regretted it. I think that was the same day Mr. Liu came up to my housemate, Ed, and asked him to translate something in his Refrigeration textbook.

The guy in the background with the multi-colored shirt is Mike Schiffer, our drummer, who we lost in 2020.
