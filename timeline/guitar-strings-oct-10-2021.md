I put new strings on my Telecaster and Stratocaster. I put "nines" on the Tele (smallest string gauge is .009), much lighter than what I usually use. It was like stringing your guitar with spiderwebs. Also, I have a method for stringing guitars that has worked great for me for years, but today I decided to watch some YouTube videos to do it the "right" way. So of course it went badly. I feel like I messed up all my strings and I'm going to need to re-string them immediately.

One of the guys who gave me advice was a soft-spoken, kindly expert, and one was Joe Bonamassa. I think they're both wrong. Actually I don't know what I think.
