This was really fun. I remember we stopped at the public library before the show, to use the bathroom, if I recall.
We stole No Books In the Bathroom sign for some kid reason. I'm sorry, Atlanta.

We were pretty excited to see Lou Reed, though the album he was touring beind, _New Sensations_ didn't stay in heavy rotation. I think he had Robert Quine with him, which was a treat we probably weren't fully aware of.
