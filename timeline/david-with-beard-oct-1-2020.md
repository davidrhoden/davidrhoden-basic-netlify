It turns out being a hermit was not so bad. I woke up, day after day, and one day I had a beard. Never happened before in my life.

I got another, better job and I thought my hermitage would be over but nw they only know me as a guy with a white beard. I'm afraid if I shave it off I'll shock them.

It's strange for me though. When I look in the mirror I wonder who this professor is.
