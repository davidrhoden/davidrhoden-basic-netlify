![dudes in Tyvek suits](/static/img/timeline/devoids-apr-20-2000.jpg "dudes in Tyvek suits")

My bachelor party was just wearing these Tyvek suits my bride-to-be's stepfather brought for me at my request. the best part was the other guys going back to their hotel in the suits (all wet, because we were testing the suits with the hose). They got in the elevator with other guests and one of them is reported to have said something like "I'm not sure we should alert Headquarters to the problem but we need to keep an eye on it." Something like that.
