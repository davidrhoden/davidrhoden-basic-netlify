This was the first Dirty Knives show and also the first [Bruisers](https://soundcloud.com/slimbolala) show. Additionally, it was the Bullies final show. Perhaps for this reason the Bullies were furious at the Bruisers who played for at least ninety minutes, maybe more, on a weeknight.

The Dirty Knives, for this one show, were me, Marcus Bronson, and Eric Michaels.
