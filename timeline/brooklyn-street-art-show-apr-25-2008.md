The Brooklyn Street Art show is this weekend, FRIDAY FRIDAY FRIDAY April 25, in beautiful Bushwick, and Jimmy and the Wolfpack will be playing the after-party at Wreck Room, at 940 Flushing Avenue, just about a block from the Ad Hoc gallery, where the show is. (Ad Hoc is at 49 Bogart Street, right by the Morgan L stop, in the building with Brooklyn's Natural and all that.) No cover that I know of. Come see the show; it's the same artists and sticker taggers you see every day around here, but on the walls of a gallery for once.
