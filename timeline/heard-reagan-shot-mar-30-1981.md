I was walking back from soccer practice when I encountered other students who told me President Reagan had been shot. It made no sense. We thought he must be dead, but didn't understand what was going on. The school didn't do anything to clarify matters, the gym staff were as clueless as the kids; we had to wait until our parents came to pick us up so we could hear some news on the radio.
