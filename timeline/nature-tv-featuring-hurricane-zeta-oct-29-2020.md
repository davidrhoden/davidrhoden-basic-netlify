Gina and I watched Hurricane Zeta blow in. It passed pretty fast but it was exciting for a while. My hurricane experience is scant, and this was the first one I'd been here for where the eye passed over us. It got very calm and the sky was greenish, especially the clouds of lightning over the city, in the distance. After the eye passed, the winds reversed direction, just like I'd been told they would. 

Here we are in the house, watching the storm before the lights went out.
