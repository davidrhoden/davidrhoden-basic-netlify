My friend Rel wrote a scary short story where a plot device was there were spooky walking skeletons, but not only that, they came to worn us of worldwide catastrophic crop failure in the not-far-off year 2038. 

I sketched these at the reading a year or so ago but just cut out these big ones in time, just in time, for Hallowe'en. The glow-in-the-dark paint showed up a day early.
