Our friend Maureen Clancy got a job at NBC, and sometimes she would call those of us still working at Golden Books and ask us to _please_ come down and be on the paings of the Conan O' Brien Show, which was not nearly as popular as Letterman. I think I went three times. I remember this was a good one, I think I was in the front row! I called mom and told her to watch for me. She may have it taped.

The funny thing is I don't remember seeing Al Franken at all. I kind of want to watch the show and see if that jogs a memory.
