I got to stay up and watch at least part of this fun movie about how much Orson Welles scared people with his Mercury Theatre _War Of The Worlds_ radio broadcast. They made the spooky sound of the Martian capsule opening by unscrewing a jar lid in a miked toilet. I guess it made me a fan or at least sympathizer for life.
