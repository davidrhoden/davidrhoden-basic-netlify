We rode to Austin with the Ka-Nives and went to Barton Springs, couldn't have been better timing. We went to see Ka-Nives at Beerland but we weren't on the bill. We decided to drive back but had to get a hotel on the way. I remember Trey and I stayed up and listened to "Don't Touch That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers" by Firesign Theater, which was an odd late night choice but we enjoyed it.
