I think this was 2000, Talbot was still playing bass with us. We took his mom's giant car, which was like an Escalade or an Expedition or something, I drove it for five minutes in Atlanta traffic before asking to be relieved.

The show went fine but wasn't well attended. I guess the Woggles had a guarante and we didn't but they gave us ten bucks for gas.
