It seems impossible to me now that [The Hi-Balls](https://hiballs.bandcamp.com/) could have got a 12 a.m. show at Brownie's, with our friends [MacArthur](https://macarthur.bandcamp.com/) no less. It's in my day planner though.

Is this the show where we went in the dressing room and there was a tall woman who played baritone sax that just reeked?
And is this the one where we parked in front of a hydrant on the trip home so Alan could get us belgian fries, which where kind of a thing at the time?
