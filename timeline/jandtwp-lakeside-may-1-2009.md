Some of my BrandWizard colleagues came out to this show. One of them, an IT guy who was really in love with himself, couldn't get enough of my white t-shirt. He kept commenting, to me and others, how stupid it looked.

I guess it's not that great a look but I was famous for sweating through my clothes. which I probably did, t-shirt or not. It still makes me mad when I think about that guy. He made fun of me at work for taking two slices of pizza one time.

Not sure who snapped these but I think it was [Amber Sexton](https://ambersexton.com).
