The opening band was called Saga. They were from Scandinavia. They had a video on MTV in which they wore the same clothes they had on in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They were not good.

Billy Squier was very good. His drummer would toss a stick about every fourth beat of some songs. He really got some height and arc on them so you wouldn't be too likely to get an eye put out.
