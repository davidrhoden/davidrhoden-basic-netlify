Katie and I went to Regas for a birthday (as evidenced by the birthday cake on thee table). I'm pretty sure it was my birthday, but can't be entirely sure. Definitely not sure of the year.

Regas was kind of a hoot. It was supposed to be _the_ fancy place in Downtown Knoxville but mostly it was just old school. It was the first and I guess the last time I went to an eating place with a lounge singer. I had the prime rib (which was what you were expected to get at Regas) and it was nice but not impressive.
