Just wasting a Post-It when I could have been earning a living. Sorry about that right arm (my right). Stuck it on wrong.

Tried to watch _Flow_ tonight. The wordless animation about a cat escaping an apocalyptic flood. I thought it would have capers and fun! It’s non-stop peril. I had to stop after 30 minutes.

Also tried to watch _Oldboy_. Made it 6.5 minutes. The character in solitary confinement without knowing the reason…started to panic.
