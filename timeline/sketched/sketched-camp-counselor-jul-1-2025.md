I drew the guy first and then decided he was a camp counselor. He maybe looks sinister or weird, but looks can be deceiving. Let's assume that's true in this case.

Most camp counselors I've encountered were o.k. Not the ones at Boyd-Buchanan Day Camp, though. They liked to see us peg each other in the face with the dodgeballs.
I wonder what it was like to go to school there. Horrible, I'd imagine. Religious school.
