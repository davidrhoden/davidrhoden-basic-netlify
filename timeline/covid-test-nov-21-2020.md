Getting ready to go home for Thanksgiving. This one wqas nice because I went to the Ochsner urgent Care on robert E. Lee Boulevard with Gina and we got to sit and wait in her van. Waiting in the car should become the standard way of waiting at the doctor. (Credit to Geoff Gauchet's tweet for that thought.)
