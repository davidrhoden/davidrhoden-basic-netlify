I particularly liked a _Nancy_ frame I saw, where Sluggo was reading signs backwards. He saw a sight saying FOOD MART and simply read it backwards as "DOOF TRAM", 

I liked it so much I edited it in Affinity Photo to create a fresh new strip. Then I posted it on boring old Facebook, because that's where my giant audience of fans lives these days.

Here's the cartoon.
