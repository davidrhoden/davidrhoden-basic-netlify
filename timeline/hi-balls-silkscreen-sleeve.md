We tried making the Hi-Balls 7" with a rudimentary silkscreen apparatus. (A Speedball kit.) It didn't work out so we found a place that did offset printing, specifically for menus, even more specifically for falafel joints. Those came out better, though they made no attempt to register the colors. So maybe a third of the covers were unusable, we paid so little for them that it didn't really matter.

These are the silk screen ones. I think four of these survive.
