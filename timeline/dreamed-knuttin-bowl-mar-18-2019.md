I saw a trailer for a film called "Knuttin' Bowl". It was like "Girls Trip" but it was based on the "fact" that both air travel and American football are declining in popularity. Three sexy African-American women decide to take advantage of discount prices on football and plane tickets to throw themselves an incredible party involving jet flights and ball games. The preview was them showing off their incredible, unrealistic couture outfits in an airport lobby. I was confused about whether it was a porno or not.
