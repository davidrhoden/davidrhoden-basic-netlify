I just want there to be a post here because I definitely went to Italy. I can't easily remember the date, but I bet I can figure it out, because when I got back, the flags were all at half-staff and I didn't knoow why. It was because President Nixon had died.

I also watched the footage of Formula 1 racer Ayrton Senna's accidental death on the track at a beach house, so those events should let me date the trip.

Nixon Apr 22 1994
Senna May 1 1994
