I'm not sure this is of general interest, but the first time I heard someone say something “sucks” was in 1979, the summer after sixth grade. I heard it at some kind of high school alumni gathering of my dad's, at somebody's country club, and it was said of McCallie (my soon-to-be high school) by Scott G., another rising 7th grader, but bound for Baylor (McCallie's local rival). 

Scott didn't just say McCallie sucks, though; he said "McCallie sucks donkey dicks", and it may be for this reason that I cringe a tiny bit when hearing someone say a thing sucks, because I mentally add the "donkey dicks" whenever I hear it. ("Wow, that movie sucked (donkey dicks)!", for example.) It was some of the worst language I'd heard from a contemporary. I thought he must be a very mature person.

Amusingly, I don't know what happened over at Baylor, but Scott G. transferred to McCallie for eighth grade, and we graduated in the same class. Guess it didn't suck as many d***** d**** as he thought.
