I loved my backyard space on Irving Avenue. I had many parties and cookouts out there. And of course I found Sally there. Always wanted Jimmy and The Wolfpack to play there! I regret that that never happened.

I will try to write some of the better stories that happened there. This is just some food pictures I have dated copies of. I'll try to get the Indian cabbage slaw recipe.
