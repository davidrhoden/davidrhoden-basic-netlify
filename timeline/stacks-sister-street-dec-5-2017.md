It was really cold and foggy, it seemed later than it was because I had been there all day. The few people left when we played stayed far back around a small fire. My hands were stiff and the guitar strings felt like fat sharp rigid wires.

Gina put on a big show/party. Her band and I think Benjamin Arthur Ellis' band played as well. It was a lot of effort. There was a vegan barbecue stand. Gina just gave the beer away. She's a champion.
