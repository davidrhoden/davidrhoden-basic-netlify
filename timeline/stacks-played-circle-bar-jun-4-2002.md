Doctor-A-Go-Go was the band that came out of the breakup of the Sleepy Heads. They had a medical theme instead of a sleep theme. i guess we were feeling friendly again.

Pocket Foxx seemed very young. I don't think they played too many shows. I think they had a parental bankroll. They were good though.

Not sure on the year.
