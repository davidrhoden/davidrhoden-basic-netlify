I had no plans for the Super Bowl but around this time I was hanging around in bars on my street or near my apartment and somebody invited me to a Super Bowl party nearby. Some of the guys had some cocaine, but they didn't offer me any, I just knew about it because someone metnioned it by way of explaining the audible tooth-grinding.

It wasn't a great pparty but the halftime show, featuring Prince tearing up a bunch of guitar solos in the rain, was, in fact, remarkable.
