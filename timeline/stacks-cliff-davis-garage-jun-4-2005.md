We really are at our best as a garage band.

Dr. Cliff Davis's garage was at 426 S. Bernadotte Street New Orleans, Louisiana. I loved playing these shows. One time (this time) he or somebody brought a bunch of Barbies to burn. Another time Little Freddie Kindg showed up and played for a bit. I once drank too much and fell asleep on Dr. Cliff's workbench, amng the curly wood and metal shavings. Ah, youth.
