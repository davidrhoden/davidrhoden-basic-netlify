![I, David Rhoden, painted the porch at 315 Tricou Street. It's green](/static/img/timeline/painted-porch-first-coat-aug-24-2025.jpg)

I didn't take any before pictures, but I bet I have a couple by accident. I don't know what the last painters did, but it was peeling by the second day after they put it on.

The color is called "Moss Covered", which is ironic since I scraped so much moss off this porch. That moss was pretty much black though.
