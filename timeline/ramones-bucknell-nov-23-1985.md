[Review from the PSU Collegian](https://www.collegian.psu.edu/arts_and_entertainment/article_5f442a89-6069-5b2c-9a08-8a191850c8cd.html)

(I found this poster on the internet, I don't own it.) The Special guest was The Reducers.

We stayed at CJ's house in Summit, New Jersey the night before. I think that was the first time I saw New York City, though it was from a distance.
