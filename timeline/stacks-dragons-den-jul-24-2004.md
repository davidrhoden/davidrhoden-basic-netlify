I don't love playing the Dragon's Den. I think it's a fire trap, and getting Trey's giant rig up the steps was a pain. But we did have a good time at this show. Both Bipolaroid and Ratty "killed it". Andy from Bipolaroid, who should be deaf by now, was super enthusiastic about our show. He would yell "STAAAACKS!" at me on the street for months after.

I ran into Sara on the street after the show (she was playing down the street) and we had an argument. Almost the last one.
