![Apartment at 532 Pacific Street.](/static/img/timeline/532-pacific-1997.jpg "Apartment at 532 Pacific Street.")

I actually loved this tiny apartment in Boerum Hill. I was so happy to find it. I'd been technically homeless for about three months (crashing with my girlfriend, to the displeasure of her housemates). It was a rent-stabilized one-bedroom. The rent was $630 or so.  This is where I lived when I started painting.

Compare with [this apartment](/timeline/315-tricou-interior/).
