I was out an a Friday night with money to spend, and I had bought an album, The Doors' _Waiting For The Sun_. I went to Pizza Caesar, probably walking from the mall to the Brainerd Village Shopping Center to get something to eat at Pizza Caesar. (This was there second llocation, after they moved from a spot near Belvoir Avenue by the Red Food Store.)

While I was there, standing outside on the sidewalk, certainly wishing for a beer, a big guy stepped out the door and said something like. This place sucks. This place is for those McCallie (somethings. Most likely "fags".)

I don't know why but I had to say something. My dad always told me to stand up to bullies. It hadn't come up too often but this seemed like such an occasion. So I said, "Well, at least we didnt lose the football game thirty three to nothing." 

The guy asked me to repat what I had said, and I did. He pushed me in the chest, and after takeg the time to set my record down, I shoved back. Then he punched me hard, a left to the jaw. I didn't feel my left jaw hinge snap off but it did. I ran back into Pizza Caeasar, becoming aware I was somwewhat injured, and sat at the table of a young couple who were enjoying a pizza in front of the big projection TV. They got up and moved to another table.

I remember some guy who said he was a doctor palpated my jaw and said it wasn't broken. I don't know who he was. Then Bev showed up with her friend Julie Johnston, and I believe Julie's mom drove us to the hospital. My parents showed up shortly. It wasn't clear that I should stay overnight but in the end I did. I think I was emotionally hard to control.

This was a hard event to date. I remember waking up in the hospital the next morning, feeling guilty because I had cost my parents a bunch of money, and because I was just in a dumb fist fight, but a lot of soldiers were killed in Beirut by a suicide bomber.
