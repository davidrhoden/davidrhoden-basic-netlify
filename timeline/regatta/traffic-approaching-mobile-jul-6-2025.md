I had a lovely visit to Pensacola this Fourth of July but for some reason the Sunday drive bak was insane. It was like evacuating a hurricane, in reverse. Every car from New Orleans must have been in Florida and decided to go back at the same time.

It's usually a three-hour drive but it took nine hours. I did spend one of those hours in a Barnes & Noble in Spanish Fort, Alabama, which was pleasant. I thought about going to the movies, but I barely missed the start of whatever Jurassic Park this is in 3D, and I really just wanted to go home. I was driving my new (to me) manual transmission truck, and I got a lot of practice starting on hills. Nevertheless, I won't do a trip like that again. I could have just stayed an extra day.
