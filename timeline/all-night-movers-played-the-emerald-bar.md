[A brief review, not of our set, by a musician who also played on the bill](https://www.jmcnicholas.com/?offset=1330373296000)

"Last night's show at the Emerald Bar was really fun. We had a packed house and All Night Movers (from New Orleans) and Michele Ari sounded great. Last night was also George's birthday so people got there early, drank hard, danced to the bands, and stayed late. Chris, Martin, John and I hit the stage about midnight and busted out some new live tunes like Check 1, 2... , Angelina, and 22 (I'm about to lose you) the later which Natty sang with us and absolutely stole the show. Wow." -- [John McNicholas](https://johnmcnicolas.com)
