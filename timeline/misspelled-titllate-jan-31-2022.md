I know it sounds like bragging if you care about such things, but I'm a good speller. Sometimes I have to think about it a bit to spell, "embarrass" but I get it right.

Today I was doing the New York Times spelling Bee game and I misspelled a word. I couldn't believe it.

The word was "titillate". I thought it was "tittilate". 

I'm really questioning everything now.
