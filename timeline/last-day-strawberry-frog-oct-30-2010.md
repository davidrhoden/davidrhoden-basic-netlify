I worked with a guy (for one day, and it happened to be the day before I moved to N.O.) in NYC. I don;t know what he was doing. Anyway we shared a big desk, we chatted, cool guy. But as the day went on he kept saying his back hurt. Then his stomach. His complaints got worse, though he was stoic about it. He said "Maybe I should go home, this seems bad." Finally he was just sitting there unable to work. His boss came around and asked what's up. Very friendly boss. He heard the story and said "That's just gas! Fart it out! You gotta fart it out!" He was rubbing the poor guy's shoulders as he said this, kinda emphasizing his words with simmultaneous pats. Another person came by and said: "Yes. I've had this. You have a kidney stone."

30 minutes later the dude was lying face down on the floor, groaning, holding his laptop bag. They finally called a cab for him. I think he had to crawl to the elevator.

I moved back to New Orleans the next day.
