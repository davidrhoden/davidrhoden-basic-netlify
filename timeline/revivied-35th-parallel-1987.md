I found this on eBay (January 2026): a fanzine I did in high school and, now I discover, in college. This would have been the "second run" of a fanzine I started in high school. It was called _35th Parallel_. That's the line of latitude on which Chattanooga, sits, so: not inexplicable, but still pretentious.
I had forgotten I tried to bring it back when I was in college, but the records reviewed in here came out in 1986 or later. So it must be from then.
I don't know who took the cover photo. I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings if I try to guess. I don't think it was me though.
