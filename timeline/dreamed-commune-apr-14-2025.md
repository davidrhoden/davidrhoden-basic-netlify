I dreamed I put all my stuff in storage and went to live in an unidentified town, where I live in a shared semi-finished loft space with a group of friends. They were younger than I am, but maybe in the dream I was also younger than I am. They were all really friendly to each other and to me and they were always coming up with cool projects to do. They were in a lot of bands. The biggest conflict was I didn't want to go to the hardcore matinees in the disused storefronts in our urban neighborhood. In fact, there was a couple really encouraging me to go, because there were two matinees in adjacent buildings one day. But I went; I guess to check it out. I saw one of the bands loading in and they had matching yellow t-shirts that said BLISS on them. They looked like they were either a Christian band or a moving company.

Then for some reason I had to give a urine sample in the hallway, but instead I woke up.
