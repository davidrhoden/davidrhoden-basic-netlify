Around Christmas Eve, I got a text from Rel saying she had bad news. A deranged man had come on her porch and basically fought with the Crop Failure 2038 skeleton. He broke it into three main pieces. (She said her porch wasn't the only one targeted--this guy tore stuff up all down the block.) My heart sank, but when I saw the pieces I thought I could fix it. Rel was having a party December 27, and I got it back up by then. I was a bit hasty with the repairs. They could be better, maybe someday they will be, but for now he's hanging on the front of the house again.
