Drew Brees completed 39 of 50 passes for 505 yards & an NFL-record-tying 7 TD passes in a 52-49 win over the New York Giants.

Sadly one memory of this game was that I didn't know vendors at the Superdome in those days only took cash.
The Dome had TWO ATMs. I checked out the line at halftime and both had about fifty people in them. I said forget it.

A cool stat on this game is all the scores in it were touchdowns until the game-winning field goal.
