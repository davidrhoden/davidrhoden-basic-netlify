My brother, sister, dad and I encountered George H.W. Bush outside a garden store. We got to talking about George W. and saying what we thought. I apologized to GHWB for our rudeness, but he said "Oh no...he's a petty, pompous little man." GHWB had a big cart full of ficus plants and the like so he left. I then noticed the dream spinach pie I was eating was really nasty, full of tangled stems.
