Gina bought this wedding tent to work under but maybe it wasn't meant to stay up in real bad weather. It started collecting rainwater in a long storm and by morning it colllapsed. She had just ordered a new cover for the tent, too. (It arrived the folowing day.) As it turned out only a few of the tent poles were bent/broken, and she was able to replace those too.
