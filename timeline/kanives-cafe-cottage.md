This was our first time meeting the Ka-Nives. The club was a coffee shop but they paid us in beer (Killian's Red). The club chose not to turn off the juke box while the bands played. Which was fine because the Ka-Nives put on a cassingle of "Maneater" and let it run while they played. Sounded interesting.
