I spent the evening dicking around with GarageBand, troubleshooting a ridiculous stutter (solution: turn your wifi off) and trying to come up with one interesting riff and one interesting lyric. It just doesn't happen anymore. I also notice I don't like too much music either. I think I might be about done with it?

Other than having fun around a campfire, hearing my own music is not that interesting to me. I still like the good stuff other people do.
