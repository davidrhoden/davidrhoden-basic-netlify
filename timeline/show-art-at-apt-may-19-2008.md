I was in a group show at this furniture store/gallery in Soho NYC. The gallery went bankrupt in the middle of the show, and the piece I sold got shipped to Israel and I never got paid for it. (The owners were to blame, not the show organizer.) I remember Jason Sho Green's art being really good, and I know he didn't get any of his work back.

The show opening was really fun though.
