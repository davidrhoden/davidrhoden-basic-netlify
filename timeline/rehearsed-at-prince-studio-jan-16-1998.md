We were in Studio F from 7 to 10.

I know this is boring but I'm trying to paint a picture for myself of what I was doing in my life, because I don't remember a lot of it.

Happily for me I have at least ten day planners from the 90s to the 2000s.

I may come up with something interesting to say about Prince Studios (other than they always tried to stick me with their Roland Chorus amp) but for now, it's just another day from my planner.
