Went with Andrew and Melanie to this club called Dodie's on Broad (which is actually called Broad Avenue, but I can't imagine Broad going with anything but Street, so I just call it "Broad". I think most people do.). We saw three bands; The Great Twenty-Eights did ALL Chuck Berry songs (not _all_ of Chuck's songs, but all they did was Chuck's songs), and Turbine 6 (named for the recalcitrant S&WB electric generator that fails and causes Mid-City to flood). In between those two bands (who were good! I want to be in an all-Chuck Berry band!) was the Don Wayne Trio, who I want to write about.

Don Wayne released a single on Swan Records in 1957. (Swan would later release a lot of records by Link Wray and I believe at least one by the Beatles, in some sort of strange licensing arrangement.) He played those two songs. The rest of his set was pretty familiar rockabilly material. He mostly played acoustic guitar, kind of haphazardly; his rhythm section was tight enough though. He switched to piano for a version of Mose Allison's "Your Mind Is On Vacation", which was the highlight for me.

I was pretty impressed by the presentation. "Don Wayne" isn't his name, as I found out when I looked up Don Wayne on Facebook, but you can find him that way. He appears to be part of an Ableton users group here in town. He's ahead of me with that stuff.

And one of the rhythm section. Usually it's the drummer you can't see. (The drummer is Tommy Oliver from the Royal Pendletons, Redondo Beat, etc.)
