Went with Andrew and Melanie to this club called Dodie's on Broad (which is actually called Broad Avenue, but I can't imagine Broad going with anything but Street, so I just call it Broad. I think most people do.). We saw three bands; The Great Twenty-Eights did ALL Chuck Berry songs, and Turbine 6 (named for the recalcitrant S&WB electric generator that fails and causes Mid-City to flood). In between those two bands was the Don Wayne Trio.

Don Wayne released a single on Swan Reords in 1957. (Swan would later release a lot of records by Link Wray and I believe at least one by the Beatles, in some sort of strange licensing arrangement.) He played those two songs. The rest of his set was pretty familiar rockabilly material. He mostly played acoustic guitar, kind of haphazardly. He switched to piano for a version of Mose Allison's "Your Mind Is On Vacation", which was the highlight for me.

I was pretty impressed by the presentation. "Don Wayne" isn't his name, as I found out when I looked up Dn Wayne on Facebook, but you cn find him tha way. He appears to be part of an Ableton user's group here in town. He's ahead of me with that stuff.

And one of the hythm section. Usually it's the drummer you can't see. (The drummer is Tommy Oliver from the Royal Pendletons, Redondo Beat, etc.)
