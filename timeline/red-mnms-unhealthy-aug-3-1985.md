We had to go record early in the morning because my brother had to leave for summer camp around noon. I think he was fourteen.

The recording went pretty smoothly, though some mistakes were made. When the engineer, Zeno, asked if we wanted to try another track, maybe clean up some of the bum notes, our drummer Sterling said, "why, we'll just make _different_ mistakes."

It was a five song cassette. I haven't heard it in years and really don't want to. I'm told it's not that bad, so I'll just accept that analysis.
