I was walking south on 3rd Avenue in NYC on a Friday afternoon in Fall and I passed a long haired bearded man in an Army jacket, also walking south, eating from a styrofoam clamshell of barbecue, with cornbread and some greens.

When we stopped for a Don't Walk sign, he stood directly behind me and said, "Motherfucker. I saw you looking at my food."
