It's been hard to get Buddy to sit still for pictures. I wanted pictures that might show a little bit of what's going on with his cloudy left eye.

_Close to a month after I took this picture, Buddy got a diagnosis. He has glaucoma in his left eye (the one to the viewer's right). He can't see out of it, and it's painful. The eye will have to be removed. As for those attractive dark freckles in his right eye, those are melanoma. Dr. DaCosta says he can remove them with a laser and Buddy will keep his sight. I'm writing this on June 23, 2024. I hope the surgeries will be scheduled for this week._
