I had to stop for gas at one of my least favorite places, the Quicky at Claiborne and Franklin.

At the pump, I noticed a pickle laying on the ground.

I don't know why, but I thought it was funny. So I took a picture of it.

A few seconds later a message popped up on my phone. It was from Google.

"Hi, it looks like you are at QUICKY MART! May we ask you a few questions about this place?" I clicked yes.

It asked "Is this place good for a a romantic date?" I clicked....yes.

"Is this place good for kids?" Yes.

"Does this place have outdoor seating?" Sure it does.

Is this place wheelchair accessible?" Why the hell not.

And so on and so on. I answered yes to every question unless it was funnier to answer no.

At the end it said, "Congratulations! You have just completed your first review. You are now a member of Google Local Guides. We will contact you occasionally to review more great local places."

So, I'm a local guide, and Google keeps using my pictures and reviews. I like to send things like a shot of the trash cans at Jimmy John's or just fake reviews. One time I was at Starbuck's in Slidell and it asked me to review the nail salon it thought I was at. I gave it three stars cause "I didn't bleed much."
