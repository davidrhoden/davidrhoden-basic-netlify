Gina and I went to Holt Cemetery on a cool day. I took so many photographs I can't post them all now.

I hope it's OK to take them and post them. Obviously I can't have the same feelings as the feelings of the people whose dead are buried here. I like to see the graves though, to see how the people remember their people. I don't think about death and memory enough.

When I go to Holt, I see where Gina gets some of her inspiration from.
