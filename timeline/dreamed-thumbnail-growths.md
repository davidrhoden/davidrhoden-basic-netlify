I worked in an ad agency housed in a ski chateau. I could do nothing right. Asked to deliver a letter upstairs, I tried to monkey climb the stairs from below; I dropped the letter in a puddle and required a rescue to get down from the stairs. I was watching some men be pulled out of the building on stretchers, short of breath, when I noticed my left thumbnail developed two growths. They looked sort of like the tops of cloves (raised circles with an embossed cross on top). The conversation turned to a chemical that was being used for a client pitch, and I noticed my thumb had grown a flat disc the size of a ginger snap, that was covered with these clove-like growths, tinted blue at the base and topped with orange.
