I heard an awful sound, like the Martians unscrewing their capsule in _War of the Worlds_. I turned to see what horror awaited, but it was just Buddy's bod scraping the edges of the microphone hole in the Stacks' bass drum. Once he squoze in he looked prretty comfortable in there. Kind of like a Martian in its capsule.
