We have read a few books out loud, I love to do it but it can take a long time because Gina falls asleep, so I guess it works as planned. This book, _New Hope For The Dead_ was funny, like the other Hoke Moseley novels, because there's so little crime-fighting. Its about seven-eighths about Hoke's domestic problems, mainly needing to find an apartment within the boundaries of Miami. Recommended.
