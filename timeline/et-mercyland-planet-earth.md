summary: The year is a guess. My brother and I were in Everything Tool. Mercyland was the out-of-town band. I don't remember meeting them but we had a cassette of their album in the car and we played it a lot.

The year is a guess. My brother and I were in Everything Tool. We were big fans of Anastasia Screamed already. Mercyland was the out-of-town band. I don't remember meeting them but we had a cassette of their album *No Feet On The Cowling* in the car and we played it a lot. 

Fast forward to now, and Mercyland's guitar player and sometimes singer is the bass player and sometimes singer in The Stacks.
