A place I worked hired a lot of programmers straight from China (you don't have to pay people as much if they depend on an H1B).  They were a quiet, insular bunch, some of them never spoke English. One day they all got excited about some food someone brought, they really brightened up, they seemed so happy. 

So they put this food in the microwave. In seconds, it smelled like someone burned a truck tire in the office. I had to open a window. But they were all eating and laughing. And one of the quietest guys, seeing a look of horror on my face, just smiled and said "Strong cheese." 
I think it was the first and last words I heard him say.

I'd love to find out what kind of cheese it was, if it was cheese.
