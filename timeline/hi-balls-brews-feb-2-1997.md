We loved playing this place. They didn't usually have bands except for an Irish thing around brunch. I found out about the upstairs room and I asked the owner of the bar, Jennifer Brew, if we could play up there, and how much it would be to rent it out. She said we could have it for free, just make sure the barteners made $200 each. Al and I stuck a $20 each on the bar to get things started and never paid for a drink after that.

Our drummer Shannon was the reasong for the success of this show as far as our band was concerned, so many of her friends came out to see her, I guess it was her first real live show. She had on a silver sequined dress that was truly showbiz.
