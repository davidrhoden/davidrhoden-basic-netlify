I painted this in about 2001 or 2002....or maybe earlier. It's the first big cut-out luchador I did. I thought the ears were outside the mask; so sue me. It seemed like they would be too hot inside. Still seems that way, to be honest.

The guy who taught me how to use a jigsaw, had it until things went south and he had to move. He asked me to watch out for it. We haven't talked in a while, but I still have it. It got really dirty though, so I washed it today. I used car wash soap since that is said not to harm paint. A few bits of paint flaked off but they were probably going any way. It looks all right for 23 or 24 years old. I don't remember if I had learned about primer at this point but I might have primed it because this paint is holding on very well.
