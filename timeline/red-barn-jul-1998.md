Sara and I spent a number of great weekends in Deposit New York hanging out at a place called The Red Barn that hosted music shows and community theater.

Sometimes when we went up, though, we'd stay at an odd bed and breakfast called Alexander's. Alexander was the owner, he was known around town, at least in part for having gotten drunk and trying to steal the city's two new bus benches. At least that was the story I heard.

One weekend (not the one pictured I don't think), we went up for a big wedding. Most every hotel room in little Deposit was sold out so I got this odd little garret room at Alecander's. It didn't seem like a hotel room. It seemed like somebody lived there.

We also noticed Alexander had some old guy sleeping on a piece of pool furniture. He said it was some guy who stayed there for free.

In the morning we were doing the breakfast part of the B&B.
