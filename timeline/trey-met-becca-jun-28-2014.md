I got a call in the evening from Barbara Ann saying she and her housemate Becca were going to Banks Street Bar and invited me to come along and bring Trey too. I had met Becca once before I hadn't formed an opinion.

We decided we would go. When we got there, Trey was his usual voluble self. I'd look over and he'd be mid-story, making big hand gestures. He got Becca to laughing and I guess she still is because I'm writing this on the same day in 2021 and Trey mentioned it was the seventh anniversary of their meeting. They've been a couple that whole time.
