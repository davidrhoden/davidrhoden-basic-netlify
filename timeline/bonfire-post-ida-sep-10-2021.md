We needed a big fire to get rid of a lot of wood and leaves that fell in Hurricane Ida, and we got one. It was too hot but it was only that way for about a minute. After that Gina took care of it.

Adam Farrington and our neighbor Nick dropped by for this one. Adam and I talked about animation, I got kind of inspired.
