I believe these nice pictures are by Amber Sexton. Was this the show where I left my amp at Freddy's and went back the next day to get it and they acted like I didn't deserve to have it? I guess I didn't. 

I'm not sure when that happened.

I like those green drums, wish that were my kit. I still have that snare, somehow.
