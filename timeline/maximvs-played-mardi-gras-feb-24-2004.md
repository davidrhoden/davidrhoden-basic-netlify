It was freezing cold, I wore a tweed blazer over my toga. We walked around and played all over. Trey and Jeff had little bitty battery powered amps and I rigged up a thing to carry a snare, no stand.

Late in the evening (meaning around 7 o'clock, probably) we stopped in Buff's Bar on Esplandae and asked if we could play. I don't think they said yes but we did it anyway.
