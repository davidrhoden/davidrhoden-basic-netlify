We stopped for barbecue in East Texas and I saw the most racistly tattooed person I think I've seen in my whole life.

we went to the Texas State Fair; it's Texas-sized, all right.

We did not go to Dealey Plaza despite my entreaties.

We did do a little thrift-shopping.

Our hotel faced the back of a Medieval Times. It was fun to see the fair maidens and the scurvy knaves out there smoking.
