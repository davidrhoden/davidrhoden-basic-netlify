We went to Union Pool to see some bands for New Year's Eve. The most notable thing was I got to met the musician Hannibal. I was told he was letting himself go blind because it was the only way he could get disability money. i got to talk to him a little bit.

He said "Lou Rawls gonna die, any day now. He's got a brain tumor. Any day now." They had spoken recently. Lou Rawls died January 6.

Picture shows the terrible mustard paint job my housemate inflicted on our place at 276 grand Street.
