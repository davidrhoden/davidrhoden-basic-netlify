This was really fun. We were "touring" on our [_Tube Or Not Tube_](https://hiballs.bandcamp.com/album/tube-or-not-tube) album, and somebody got a bunch of truck inner tubes to make a kind of backdrop for us. these got rolled around while we played.

The "Strathmore Ballroom" was Joe Kight's apartment on St. Philip Street. We spent a lot of time over there at this time. A handful of fun shows happened there.
