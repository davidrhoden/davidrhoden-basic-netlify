Karl was a guy Shannon knew who lived way out in Brooklyn, or maybe Queens. We played a "quiet" acoustic set in a corner of the kitchen. There were dancers, and we got the floor moving so much that Karl's glass-front hutch where he kept all his dish ware fell over, smashing itself and its contents.

We bought him a flat of wine glasses the next day. He said it was worth it and we shoudn't have bothered.
