I was walking down 6th Street in Austin one lunch hour when i saw a group of people with cameras out, looking up.

A guy had backed out through the wire barricades that are supposed to keep your car from falling out of the building but obviously don't.

The driver was able to get out of the car and climb to safety unassisted. Maybe he even got his car back.
