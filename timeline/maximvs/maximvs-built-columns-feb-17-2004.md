![MAXIMVS! with the columns, The Big Top, New Orleans, February 18, 2004.](/static/img/rock/maximvs/maximvs-big-top-feb-18-2004/jeff-and-trey-feb-18-2004.jpg "MAXIMVS!")


Honestly, these were miles ahead or above what any other bands were doing at the time. Of course we built them right before the show. When we toured, later in the year, we cut them in two and hinged them so they could fold in half and be packed on top of my Volvo. When we got to the out of town showws were were either too tired or just too frazzled to unload them and set them up. Essentially we drove some fake columns around the Southeast but didn't let anybody see them.
