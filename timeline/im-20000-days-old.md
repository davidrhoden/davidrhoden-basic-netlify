By my calculations I turned 20,000 days old today.

I forgot to plan anything. Maybe I could do something like rank them (just the top 10,000 or so.)
I could get a cake with one of those big number 2 candles and four 0s.
Or do nothing. Anyway, just felt like taking note of it.
I'll be 30,000 days old on Tuesday, April 20, 2049.
