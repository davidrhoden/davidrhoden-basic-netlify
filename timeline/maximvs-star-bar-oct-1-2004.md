This one started out fine. No big problems except my hi-hat stand absolutely disintegrated mid-show. Not sure how that happened. Otherwise, great gig. The other band on the bill was called Lust, and they rocked. It was a fun night all around. After the show though, there was a somewhat unruly patron at the Star Bar who proclaimed for all to hear that he had just gotten out of jail, and he was ready to have a good time. He continued to be a loudmouth, but we could have easily left Atlanta without tangling with him.

Unfortunately Jeff decided to talk to this guy, asking him a rhetorical question along the lines of "Hey, guy, how much does your girlfriend charge?"

The guy seemed to let it go, but a few minutes later, the guy came up to Trey, punched him in the mouth, pointed at Jeff and yelled: "You shouldn't be in a band with that guy!"

Jim Stacy and the other owner (sorry on the name) threw the guy out with extreme prejudice (i.e., fists), but the damage was done. Trey's mouth was all cut up from the punch.

More about this in the next tour diary installment.
