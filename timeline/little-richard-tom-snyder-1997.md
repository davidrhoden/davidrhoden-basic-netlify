I saw this live when it was first aired.

Tom Snyder: "And why did your best friend kill your dad?"
Little Richard: "Well, they had a little peanut machine..."

I was so excited when he mentioned Chatttanooga. (20:55) His remarks on color and ethnic food have always stuck with me. He gets louder and louder, the longer he talks.

"I've never been conceited; I'm convinced!"
