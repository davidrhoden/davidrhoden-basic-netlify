I dreamed I went to a "rock and roll weekender" that had something to do with WFMU. I met tons of cool girls who had boyfriends I didn't meet. 

I rode in a van driven by Stephen Malkmus of Pavement. He was a terrible and fast driver, barely keeping the van on the road. He nearly took out a mailbox but seemed unconcerned, like you'd expect from Stephen Malkmus, really.

The end of the dream, though was that I had shared a room with six other people who all abandoned their belongings in the hotel room and I needed to check out by noon. I was pretty sure I didn't have enough money on my credit card to cover the cost of the room.
