Wayne White set up a show in a former coffee shop near downtown Chattanooga. It was a Chattanooga-centric show, with big statues of Adolph Ochs and Bob Brandy.

There was a big model of Lookout Mountain with a working Incline Railway (though it wasn't working that day because "a kid was fooling with it"). It had little moving cars going up and down the curvy mountain roads.

This is just a little model of the big model. The big one was too big to easily take a picture of. Love the way he showed "See 7 States".
