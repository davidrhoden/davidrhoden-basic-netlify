I worked side-by-side with a developmentally disabled man named Al. When I was doing a sloppy job on the dish line, the boss, Paul, would say "you're acting like Al."

One time I was putting a five-gallon sack of milk in the milk dispenser (yes the milk comes in a plastic sack). I dropped it and it blew up, covering the floor. Everybody clinked their glasses with their forks.
