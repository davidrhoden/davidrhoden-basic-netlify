Ariel invited me to go to Saturn Bar and see these jazz groups. I actually enjoyed it, maybe more than she did. It seemed like these were all Loyola student groups, just jusdging by hw they looked and dressed. It was pretty nice for the most part, soft, Rhodes piano-y music like the theme to _Taxi_, or Vince Guaraldi music. One of the leaders introduced each song by explaining how it had to do with something from her life in Maine, but I think these songs would have sounded the same no matter where she grew up.

But it was fun to listen to! Two of the groups brought up a trombonist named Remy (?), as it was his birthday. He was a good player. One group did a version of "Revelation", which I think is a song on John Coltrane's _A Love Supreme_, an album I liked when I was a college student, so that made sense. They also did "Ghosts" by Albert Ayler, which sounded familiar, but I can't say I've ever heard it, so maybe it sounds like something else.
