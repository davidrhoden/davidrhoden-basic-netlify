Lounge Lizards was always good for us; it seems like the wrongest place to see the Ka-Nives but, you know, any Ka-Nives show is better than anybody else's show anywhere.

The Spinns, who we knew from MAXIMVS, were good too. Those guys loved to drink. The bass player basically went missing.

I'd later play one show in Brooklyn (at Don Pedro's) with the Spinns' Todd Colberg's band. I don't know if we even had a name for that gig.
