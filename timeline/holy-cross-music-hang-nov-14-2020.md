Gina put on an outdoor music show in her yard so people could stay socially distant but still be kind of sociable and hear some music.

The day started with Stoo Odom, solo.

Followed by Max Bernardi's group, the Souvenaires.

There was plenty of room so the crowd could be socailly distanced.

Then Gina's group, billed for the afternoon as "Gina Phillips and Friends" (Ross Karsen, Marcus Bronson, and Doug Garrison)

Close to sunset the levee filled up with spectators too.

I didn't get any photos of Malevitus somewhow but I shot some video of them when this art car pulled up.
