I was walking down 6th Street in Austin one lunch hour when i saw a group of people with cameras out, looking up.

A guy had backed out through the wire barricades that are supposed to keep your car from falling out of the building but obviously don't. I think the lowest wire didn't snap, but instead caught the front wheel of the car, preventing it from falling several stories to the ground.

According to the news, the driver was able to get out of the car and climb to safety unassisted.
