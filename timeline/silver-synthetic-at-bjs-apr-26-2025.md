I went to Silver Sythetic and Chris Acker at BJ's. It was a beautiful Saturday night, and there were twice as many people at the show than could fit in the bar at once.
Silver Sythetic is terrific, but they remind me of a near-perfect hybrid of Beachwood Sparks and Apples in Stereo, two bands that Sara loved and played a lot. Soundtrack to my marriage and divorce.
It's very gentle rock. Quite nice though. Loads of guitar.

Sorry I cut the keyboard player out of this shot, I didn't know I did that.
