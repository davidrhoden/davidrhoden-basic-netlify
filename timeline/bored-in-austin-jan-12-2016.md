I continue to enjoy lots of media. Today it was:

_Song Of The Sea_, which was like an Irish Miyazaki film, beautiful drawings, a sweet, scary folk tale in the Campbell tradition. The kid actors were so good; it was like Charlie Brown Christmas—please tell me those were really kids. The adults were good too, really unlikable and full of stupid ideas that lead to actions that cause problems later on in the story.

Also, I linked to the trailer here, [(_Song Of The Sea_)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgbXWt8kM5Q), but I suggest you don’t watch it. It gives away things the movie holds on to. It’s a movie about oral storytelling, and though it is somewhat predictable, as it’s based on folktales, which I presume you’ve heard, you want to watch it without spoilers and just enjoy it in the order it’s told, and with the suspense the teller presets you.

The NEW ELO album, _Alone In The Universe_ (found as individual tracks on YouTube). Who knew? It sounds like an old ELO album.

And:
Joe Belock’s excellent hour of Bowie deep tracks (not one but two Springsteen songs!) and loving covers by such as the Muffs and Superchunk on WFMU’s Three Card Monte show, which is archived at WFMU’s [Most Recent Archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20160115010223/http://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/64545) (and this link will still work even when it’s not a most recent archive).
