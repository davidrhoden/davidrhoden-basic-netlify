He loves making biscuits on this red plaid blanket. At night he likes to push it up against my butt and make biscuits that way. I can only imagine it is very satisfying.

One time he came in the house and I thought he had clumps of bloody fur between his claws, but I figured out it was just bits of his biscuit blanket.
