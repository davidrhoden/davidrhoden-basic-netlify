*["For Some Fans, Accusations of Rape Crumble Bill Cosbyâ€™s Wholesome Image"](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/arts/bill-cosby.html)*, Kate Zernike, _The New York Times_, November 22, 2014.

A man in an overlarge suit walked up to me the parking lot of the HEB on Burnet Road and asked in a Texas voice if I'd be willing to be interviewed for a story on Bill Cosby. I asked for what publication and he said The New York Times. OK, sure. He asked me what all I thought about Bill and his recent troubles and I told him. but he also asked a lot of questions about my family, like what my dad's name was, and in the car driving home I became convinced he meant to steal my identity. but I looked him (David Montgomery) up on LinkedIn and sure enough, he was a respected journalist.

I told Trey about this and he asked if I had done my Cos impression for the guy. And I said "Noooooo! My biggest chance to take it national and I just spaced." I was sitting there feeling regretful, when the phone rang. It was David Montgomery, conferencing me in with NYT writer kate Zernike, asking if they could get a few more of those good quotes for the article.

I said, "Sure! And do you want to hear my Cosby impression?" They mentioned it in the paper.
