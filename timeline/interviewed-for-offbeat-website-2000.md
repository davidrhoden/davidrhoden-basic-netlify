I interviewed for the "job" of managing the _Offbeat_ website. Date is approximate.

I met with the editor herself. She yawned all through the interview. She blamed it on a heavy lunch. I named a price that I'm now embarrassed about, way too low. She countered that she had hoped we could work out somethiing in trade.
Like, free magazines, I guess? An ad for a web developer in a music magazine? I guess I could have picked up some music clients who would pay me in CDs.

I never belonged in that business.

They have an okay website now. I wonder who talked sense into them. Maybe whoever did it did it for trade.
