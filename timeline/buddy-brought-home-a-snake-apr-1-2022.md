Buddy brought home a little friend he found outside. For a cat, Buddy is pretty merciful toward his pets. It never seems like he's interesting in _really_ catching them. He seems like he wants to play. Then again, I'm coming at it from a person's perspective, not that of a tiny snake.

There might be dozens or hundreds more of these where this one came from. And by the way, I caught the snake and let him go outside. He seemed fine.

Based on a little internet research, I think this was a [brown snake](https://www.louisianasportsman.com/field-notes/snake-i-d-louisianas-snakes-identified).
