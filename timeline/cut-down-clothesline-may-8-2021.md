This pole is (or was) in the middle of my yard by the path to my door. The point of it was to hold up a clothesline. We don't dry our clothes that way anymore (and we'd need a second one somewhere to make it work) so I decided to cut it down because it's a pain to mow around. But, damn, I wasn't prepared for it to have TWO pieces of inch-thick rebar inside to cut through as well.

I did remove it. Buddy helped.
