The Chalmette Battlefield (site of the Battle of New Orleans, which took place after the end of the War of 1812, or before the end, if you ask the people who fought in it) is just a couple of miles down the road from my house but I'd never been. We rode our bikes out there on a cold, sunny December afternoon.
