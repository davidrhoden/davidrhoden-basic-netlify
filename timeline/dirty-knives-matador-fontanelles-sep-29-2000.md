What I wrote about it at the time on the Dirty Knives website:

_Pretty good night: Fontanelles UK turned out to be crazy: Josh spazzes out all over the place and I mean that in a good way, Eve, the drummer, plays a little stand up kit and appears to be very happy. They have a lot of good songs and they are probably deaf. Somehow we came on and rocked....rocked in kind of a stentorian manner, like a large wall, one that is about to tumble. If I do say so myself. Thanks for coming._
