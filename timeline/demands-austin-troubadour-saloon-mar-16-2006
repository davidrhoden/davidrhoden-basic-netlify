Regular Demands guitarist John Pardo couldn't make this one-off gig in Austin during SxSW (but _not_ part of SxSW) but I was in the mood to go. We also took Annie the chinese medicine doctor and another woman with us to wear cute outfits and dance. The drummer was Memphis Mike and the bass player came from Holland, I kid you not. We met him at the gig.

It was a fun quick trip to Texas. We probably saw some other bands.
