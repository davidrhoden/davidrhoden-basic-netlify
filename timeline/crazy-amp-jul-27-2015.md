I saw this vintage Deluxe Reverb amplifier advertised on craigslist for $600. They usually go for $1200 and up, so I was interested.
I called the number and the guy said to come look at it. He was eager to sell, so eager that he dropped the price a hundred dollars on the phone, before I'd even seen the thing. He was just two turns away from me, a left on Burnet Road and a right on his street.

I found him in the back of an apartment complex. He was in a shed, the sort of thing an apartment complex would have to store paint and mops and rakes and such, but he was living in there with all that stuff. He had a TV and a bed crammed in there. He had the amp on the bed.

I had brought a guitar, and I asked if I could try it out. He said sure. I played a little while he kept saying kind of unintelligble nonsense about the amp having extra tubes and such. He said it had belonged to a psychedelic band from San Antonio who used it in the early seventies. After I played it for a few minutes, he yanked my cable out of the jack and said "Well, do ya want it or not??"

I decided to take the risk though my trust level in this guy was a little bit low. But I took it hoe, and excitedly started to look it over. And sure enough, it _did_ have an extra tube in there, and an added master volume knob (on the back) and a weird knob that was unmarked, but the higher you turned it, the less midrange you got. (I'm told in was a mid-range attenuator or something.)

It was cool as hell, a great sounding amp, but it stopped working in about the third hour I used it.

(I eventually got it fixed in New Orleans. It weighed eighty pounds and I fearewd it get hurt if I actually tried to use it for gigs. So I sold it to another poor boy for the same $500 I paid for it. I do miss it a little.)
