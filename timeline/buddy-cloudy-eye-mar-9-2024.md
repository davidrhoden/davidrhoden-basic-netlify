  Buddy finally let me get a picture of his cloudy eye.

  He came home one day and it was like this.
  The doctor precribed a steroid/antibiotic cream that I applied to his eye twice daily, but nothing changed.

  I don't think it affects his vision much. He doesn't act like there's anything wrong.
