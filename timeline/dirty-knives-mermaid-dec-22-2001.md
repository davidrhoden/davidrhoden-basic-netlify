The first thing to say about this show was the Forty Fives wiped the floor with us. They were finishing aa tour and had gotten so tight since our previous show opening for them.

We had a new drummer for this show. I regret that decision. Not because I didn't like our new drummer (Shawn Washburn), or didn't think he was good. I just felt like we should have kept on with Dan. I feel like asking him to leave hurt our friendship, and that we lost a really creative artist and musician.
