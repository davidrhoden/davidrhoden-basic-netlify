![flyers for a rock show: Stacks and Sutures, Octovber 8, 2004.](/static/img/rock/stacks-flyer-sutures-oct-8-2004.jpg)

 I'm sorry, I don't remember The Sutures at all. I don't know if they were local or from out of town.

 I do wonder if this is the gig where the band (minus me) played an encore of "Tequila" and Chan fell off the front of the stage.
