I couldn't go vote yesterday; I'm really sick and it just wouldn't be fair to those nice old people that work the polls. But there was only one thing on the ballot, and that was whether to approve a millage, a small tax on property holders in the parish, that would fund some activities and payroll for the sheriff's department. So, something that doen't affect me, probably. (Though you never know.) What difference could it make if I missed it?

Well, here are the results.
