I hardly ever see movies on opening night (and if I ever write about seeing Tim Burtons _Planet Of The Apes_ on opening night, you'll know why) but this was a fun group of friends. I was in such a celebratory mood that I did something I never do, which is smoke pot. It wasn't the stupefying kind that makes me afraid and paralyzed (i.e., most pot) but I was a bit altered nonetheless.

The movie was good and interesting, and it didn't bother me that I was having a hard time following it. But that night about 1 a.m., opening the refrigerator, I thought: "What the hell was that? How did they make and release a movie like that? It didn't make any sense! And who was that guy at the end, what did he want?" I'm still a bit puzzled about that last one, actually.

You have to remember this was opening night. There was no lore yet. Nobody had seen "the Jesus" put his tongue on a bowling ball yet, only a select few were aware that had happened. "A toe? I can get you a toe" hadn't entered the discourse. "The dude abides" didn't seem like it meant anything. 

It was a while before I changed my attitude about the movie and the Coen brothers. I did, of course; I finally saw _The Big Lebowski_ again (probably with a note pad in hand) and loved it. Maybe all Coen brothers movies require a second viewing for me. (_No Country For Old Men_ did, it went from a D- to an A+ for me. It won Best Picture for the rest of you.) I'm on board now, although I saw Joel Coen's _Macbeth_, and it went down in my opinion the following day. (See the Roman Polanski one, it's really something.)
