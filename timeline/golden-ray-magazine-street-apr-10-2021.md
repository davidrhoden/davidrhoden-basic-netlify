My new band Golden Ray played a show on a porch on Magazine Street. I thought we were playing a private party, but no, this friend of our drummer's simply extended the invitation for us to play on his porch. It turned out to be a pretty well attended show. We didn't not make money.  Plus we went to Parasol's afterward so I was well-pleased.

It's David and Andrew from The Stacks, along with new drummer Brian Tierney. We're doing half Andrew's songs and half Dave's, switching off on bass and guitar.

I've got more pictures than this.

Here's what we sound like.
