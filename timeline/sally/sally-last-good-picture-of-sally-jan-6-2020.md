  Sally left us. She went out on a Friday morning and when I got home she wasn't waiting for me.
  She jumped over Buddy, who was dawdling as always in the doorway. She wasn't sick, which is what everyone tells me to think.
  She was always a determined cat, and that's how I think of her now, jumping over slow, deliberative Buddy.
  I don't know what happened, and maybe that's how it should be.

  I miss her every day.
