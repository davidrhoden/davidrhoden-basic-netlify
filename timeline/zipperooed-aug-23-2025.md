The fellow checking out in front of me at Canseco's brought his own insulated bag, for ice cream and the like, you know.
And the fellow bagging the groceries asked him “would you like the bag zipperooed?”
And the shopper requested clarification: “Zipperooed?”
And the bagger confirmed that he did, in fact, ask if he wanted the bag zipperooed.
Naturally I also said I would like my bags zipperooed.
