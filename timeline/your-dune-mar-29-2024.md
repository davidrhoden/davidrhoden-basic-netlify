I dreamed I went biking down a hilly dirt road because someone told me there was a good place to eat at the end of it. I got there and it was a very standard cafeteria.
I put a lot of food on my tray, along with a book I was reading (_Dune_, by Frank Herbert). But then I figured out: it wasn't my tray. A big, mean looking guy was carrying it all away. So I went and sort of mimed an explanation that I had accidentally loaded up _his_ tray with _my_ food, and I tried to look sheepish, but he was mad anyway. In the end I forgot my book, and he mockingly said "What about your _Dune_, man? What about your _Dune_??" to the cackling laughter of his friends.
