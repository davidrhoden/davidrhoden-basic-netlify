Gina and I went to Santos and saw two terrific bands, Redondo Beat (who I'd played with a couple of times) and Tyler Keith and The Apostles.

I've been a big fan of Tyler's for years. Amazingly I can't remember if If I've played a show with him or not, I've just been to so many.

I liked his last album but it doesn't have the name on the spine (it doesn't have a spine, such was the pressing) so I don't play it as much as I mean to.

After this show everything got locked down.
