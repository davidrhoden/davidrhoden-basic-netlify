I took advantage of living on what at the time was one of the coolest addresses in the world to hang out at the corner coffee shop, which was what people did then. It was called Atlas Café. I was probably in a TV On The Radio video they were filming. It's where I first heard "The Bottomless Hole" by The Handsome Family. All the chairs and tables were wobbly. I would take nice shims from the Home Depot with me when I went, and leave them behind. For some reason they seemed not to like this, preferring the wadded-up napkins and matchbooks less prepared customers employed.

I've never been great at getting actual work done in coffeeshops. For one thing, I wind up having to go to the bathroom, which means packing up your laptop (unless you're one of these blessed wild children who just leave it on the table), which means you don't have a table anymore.

It was a nice place though, and I got to meet people by going there. And since I had such pitiful jobs around this time, I wound up doing a website for a woman I ment there, Tina DeRamus. I don't think any money changed hands, maybe a hundred bucks or something. It was a very simple portfoliio site for her creepy art. Here's a screenshot I found on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20070727145940/http://www.tinaderamus.com/index.php?id=7).
