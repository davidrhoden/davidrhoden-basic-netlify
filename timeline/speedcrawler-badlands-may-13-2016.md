Fun little band I was briefly the drummer of. We rehearsed a bunch but I think we just played three shows. We did misfits covers and unlikely country songs really fast. I liked it a lot. Honestly, the funnest tape I have of this band is when a friend of the bass player came to check us out "for a video he was shooting" and he was so high on Adderall he was like a comet. I have it somewhere.
