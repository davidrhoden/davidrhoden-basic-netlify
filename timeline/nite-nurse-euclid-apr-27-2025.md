I finally say Josh Lee Hooker's Nite Nurse, and they were terrific. Josh is a funny guy, very witty, but he takes the rock seriously as gospel. He's surrounded himself with some great players, two of whom were totally new to me. The set was not long, two covers (Neil Young and Rolling Stones deep cuts) to five originals, all of which were excellent. The lead guitarist really complements Josh's guitar playing. At times they were both finger-picking, and that sounds fancy. The bass player was all energy, getting a big sound out of a short scale Fender, and Nick on drums brings just enough Keith Moon. (Also I've seen him play the drums on several occasions, and he manages to totally rock without needing to use a lot of volume--he was playing this show with felt mallets.)
