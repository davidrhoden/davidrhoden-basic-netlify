I'm taking a course in Blender, the free 3D software used by many animators to do 2D animation. It looks amazing. Unfortunately it beachballs my MacMini (which turns ten this year). I don't want to see it on my MacBook Pro which is going on twelve.

I want to learn it, I want to make 3D versions of my drawings, but I don't think waiting on a computer is the best use of my time. Maybe I can get an older version of the software with easier technical requirements?
