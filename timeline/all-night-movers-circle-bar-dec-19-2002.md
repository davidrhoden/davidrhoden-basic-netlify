My main memory of this is show is some fat greasy dude fell asleep/passed out in a chair in the performance area. So I jumped on him and woke him up. He didn't like it. I didn't like it too much either.

The other thing I remember is I started this show with a watch on, and ended it weithout a watch. I didn't notice it coming off. Didn't even look for it. I've never worn a watch since.
