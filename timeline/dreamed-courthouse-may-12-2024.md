I dreamed I lived in a civilized prosperous country and I had to go to the courthouse. Everything was nice and clean, everyone was nicely dressed. But I was looking for a bathroom. I looked in the first logical place but there were only a pair of "ritual rooms", marked to indicate one was for Jews and one was for Hindus.

While I was looking around I found the courthouse bookstore. It had shelves around the perimeter about thirty feet high, with ladders. In the center was a pleasant, quiet caf√©. There were high clean windows. And there were books everywhere.

I looked in the basement of the courthouse but still didn't find a bathroom, and a custodian shooed me out.

I decided to walk to a movie theater nearby that was having a one-day-only showing of _Nashville_. The movie theater also sold a delicious hot sandwich on focaccia bread and I wanted that too. But when I went in I still needed to find a bathroom. They were out of the focaccia sandwiches, so I got a tuna fish on rye with lettuce and tomatoes that looked pretty good, put it in a long (3') styrofoam box, stuck the box under my arm, and went into the bathroom, where I realized I had taken the sandwich without paying.
