Gina hosted a bonfire for me and our little friends Oscar and Sylvie and their parents. We made s'mores, probably the first time in thirty-five years for me. Then Oscar found one of those ratcheting "cuffs" you use to organize cable, and the said he was going to take us to jail and give us "yummy soup and yummy alcohol". We think he's mixing up "yummy" and "yucky" but we were all happy to do the time.
