In a dream, I was biking with my father and my uncle. I was riding a Sears folding bike my dad gave me as a kid. We rode a long way, all the way to another town. The town was deserted it was night time, but I looked in the window of a former gas station at the top of a hill, and it had become an incredible hobby shop, all stocked with models and paint. It was time to go, so Pop and my uncle started back, at which point I discovered I had a flat back tire. I yelled for them to hold up, but they were way down the hill rounding a bend. There was nothing for me to do but go back up the hill and see if the former gas station had a pump.

At this point I had to put my bike on my back and climb up a narrow, slippery metal thing, like an air duct. (I wasn't surprised, my dreams often have me climbing narrow, unstable things.) I made it to the top. Now it was day and there were high schoolers everywhere, but a beautiful young woman with short dark hair and dark eyes came to greet me and welcome me to the hobby shop. It was hers. Of course I woke up before I could buy anything, but I got to look around a little. Didn't see my dad and my uncle again.
