My friend Brian had become friends with the bartender of this place, Marlene's, because they both lived in motorhomes on top of a floor coverings warehouse. It does seem like an intersting thing to have in common. Anyway, the bartneder had invited Brian to drop by any time so one friday afternoon we did. Alec, Brian, Court, and I, David, made a nice alphabetical group of customers. In fact we were the only customers.

The place was really strange. "Poor taste" doesn't begin to cover it. It was like a bad trip. I took this one picture of the "ballroom". Maybe I wasn't supposed to. I'm not sure I should post it for the public to see; maybe everyone should pay his or her own visit to Marlene's and experience it first-hand.

Those legs, by the way? They're not just disembodied legs. They're tables, for setting your drinks on.
