summary: I said I would only be in the band if I could play drums. The thing is, I didn't know how to play drums.

MAXIMVS! started when the "Three Ring Circus" girls (Kirah Haubrich, Adele Borie, and Tracy Kennan) decided to throw a "Roman orgy", or more accurately a dinner where you would lie down to eat.  They wanted to have "entertainments" and somehow Jeff Pounds go tht e idea that they wanted a band. He brought the idea to Trey, who brought it to me. I said I'd do it, but we had to wear togas, duh, and I wanted to play drums. The fact that I didn't have drums or play drums was not my concern.

The show went great, I guess. Doug MacCash wrote it up in the Times-Picayune, mentioning my tendency to put the drumsticks up my nose, in passing. I bet Mom was proud.

The picture above is actually from a later show (February 18), I know that because we used the money we got paid for this gig ($150?) to buy the wood to make the columns.
