summary: We only had one new song ("Heading For The Texas Border") which we didn't even write, but since this was a new venue and a new crowd for us, what's the difference? We played really hard and loud - Sara's amp was hot enough to fry a dog's brain. I liked us!

AUGUST 1 2001\
Dixie Taverne (New Orleans) with [Bright Calm Blue](http://www.brightcalmblue.com), and [To Dream Of Autumn](http://www.todreamofautumn.com)\
We only had one new song ("Heading For The Texas Border") which we didn't even write, but since this was a new venue and a new crowd for us, what's the difference? We played really hard and loud - Sara's amp was hot enough to fry a dog's brain. I liked us! The audience was very *serious*- at one point I whispered "everybody dance" in the mike, like Corky in *Waiting for Guffman*, and four or five dudes *walked out of the room*. I saw some devil horns though, and they clapped real loud.\
The other bands were "screamo" bands, which is a kind of "emo" which is a kind of musical genre...I'm not really sure what it is. Bright Calm Blue came on and just wiped the floor with us - total volume and chops. the screaming was absolutely unintelligible. I liked it! I can't review the other bands because my ride was leaving.
