  I know somebody can name this impressive bird, but I can't. I think it's a Missisippi Kite, but maybe it's too big for that?

  Speaking of kites, on the same walk I saw this apparently unmanned kite flying above the swing where the canal meets the river.
  There were a bunch of kids and a dad there but I never saw any of them do anything that looked like "flying a kite". It was mysterious.
