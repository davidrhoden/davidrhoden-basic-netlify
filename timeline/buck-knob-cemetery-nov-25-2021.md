It looked like a steep briar-covered hill, but there was a sign in front of the lot that said Buck Knob Cemetery. I saw the stones scattered among the weeds and briars, so I decided to walk, or hike, up there and take a look. I feared I was walking into a jungle of poison ivy, but I got lucky, or there wasn't too much poison ivy up there.

This cemetery is on Dartmouth Street in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
