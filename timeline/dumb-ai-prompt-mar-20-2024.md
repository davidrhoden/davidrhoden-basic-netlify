My Google Chrome updated itself, and there was a splash screen to explain the new "help me write" feature. Apparently people can no longer write simple notes without the help of a computer. See this example:

So....what was wrong with the sentence in the prompt? "I'm interested in this place - do you allow dogs?" If I were a landlord, that's about exactly what I would want to hear. I don't need them to butter me up any more than that. If they say "It's exactly what I'm looking for", what does that add? Should I raise the price, since it's so perfect?

I don't think I need to say any more.
