WTUL (the Tulane student radio station) sponsored some Wednesday night shows at Tipitina's that were supposed to be broadcast live but I don't think they ever were. We played with The Forty Fives a couple of times on their tour. The first time they were great, the second time was the end of their tour and they were fantastic, completely tight. We had changed drummers and kind of gotten worse in the meantime.

Is this the show that we recorded for Dirty Knives Greatest Hits Volume 2 LIVE?
