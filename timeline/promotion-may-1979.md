![St. Nicholas promotion.](/static/img/timeline/promotion-may-1979.jpg "St. Nicholas promotion")

Our eleentary school had "Promotion" instead of calling it graduation. I think this picture is from my sixth grade promotion (which would equal graduation) but the date is approximate.

It was a short ceremony in the church and then you went to the courtyard and had ginger ale with lime sherbet in it.
