![I'm Over It, painting by David Rhoden. Oil on cardboard.](/static/img/paintings/im-over-it-dec-17-2017.jpg?nf_resize=fit&w=960)

I was absolutely done with my Clark Street place and my intrusive, annoying landlord, whose name I've perhaps happily forgotten but I'm sure I'll remember.  The heat bills were as high as the rent.

I heard the garbage men chuckling at this piece after I hung it facing out my front window.
