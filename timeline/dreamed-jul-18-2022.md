I dreamed I got a new job and Jack White was my mentor. We got Chinese food and then went to a gun and knife shop in the same mall. There was a machine gun with an 8-track player and he asked me what 8-track I would put in it. I said Bread because you could find 8 tracks of it anywhere. He was unimpressed with my answer, he thought I would suggest something a lot hipper from the blues genre.
