I never did quite understand how we got these. i went with Ray, Tom, and Noy. We arrived (on our bikes, coming over the ferry) too late to use the All Access part. But the show made me a believer. We were standing right up front (Chad Booth a.k.a Gary Wrong, was right up there too, with the fam.) It was like a beach music show. They did "Hey Baby." I'd always dismissed Huey but what a great show. I now own _Sports_.

We almost missed the last ferry back, we'd all had a lot to drink and weren't biking at maximum efficiency.
