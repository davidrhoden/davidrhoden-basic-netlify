I didn’t mean to watch the whole thing (it’s twenty minutes) but this is a really remarkable film. I don’t need to give it much introduction except to say that the “people” scenes are great but the candymaking scenes will blow your heart and mind away. I was hooked when the man snipped a huge slab of cooling molten sugar with enormous scissors. Just watching the men and women and machines shove the goo around is amazing. The specialized candymaking tools will bring you great joy.

If you must skip, you crazy person, skip to about minute sixteen, when the narrator says to the woman, “It’s a little bit like poetry, isn’t it?” It is, she says, and it is. But watch the whole thing. That part is better if you’ve seen how the candy makers work already.
