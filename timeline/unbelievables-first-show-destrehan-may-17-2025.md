My new band, for now called The Unbelievables, played a big yard party yesterday, in Destrehan. It went great, crowd liked it. People danced. Somebody let a cute little girl take the tip jar around, adorable but then we had to sing "Happy Birthday" to the little tyke (Andrew started it). We got swarmed by Formosan termites as the sun went down but it only lasted a song or two.

Set list:
Can I Change My Mind
Take My Love
Ainâ€™t No Love In The Heart Of The City
Grits Ain't Groceries
Natural Man
Who Will The Next Fool Be?
Feel So Bad
To Love Somebody
Ninety-Nine and a Half Won't Do
Coal Miner
Don't Let The Green Grass Fool You
These Arms Of Mine (this went over the best)
Running Back To You (I dedicated it to Alvin Kamara but I don't think the crowd got it)
First I Look At The Purse
Dark End Of The Street
