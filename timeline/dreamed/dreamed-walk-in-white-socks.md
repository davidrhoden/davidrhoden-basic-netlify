I was staying in the woods with Matt and Al, and Leslie showed up and said she wanted a divorce. Al left immediately and I had to walk back home (he was my ride). I was in Brooklyn then, walking down slushy streets in just white tube socks that were falling off my feet, and I had left my wallet behind. I had to turn around.
