In my dream, I was an adult, basically present-day me, but I was starting a new school and I had an advisor, and we went to the mall. We stopped in a vintage store and he found a sweatshirt from his alma mater, Oak University. I said what are their teams called, the Acorns? He said, no, they were the Redwoods. This frustrated me.
