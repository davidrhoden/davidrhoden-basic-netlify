I dreamed I was talking to my pop. There were a number of skydivers parachuting down, with long, long shroud lines, and I commented that it looked like fun, even though their falls were out of control until they reached the end of the slack in the lines, and they slammed into normal parachuting position. He was trying to tell me about his friend, a former pilot, who decided he wanted to die on his boat. It seemed like a good story, but I had to keep interrupting because I couldnâ€™t understand a lot of his words. It was like the dream was breaking up.

Im a dream from the same night (or morning), I dreamed my mother asked me to disassemble a lot of Legos that we had apparently assembled as kids. This small job was made less pleasant byt the numerous other plastic toys that had been stored with the Legos, and had gone soft and sticky in the meantime.
