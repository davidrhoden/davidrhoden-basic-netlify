I had a really nice dream that I had some time and went back to college at the University of New Hampshire, in Manchester, New Hampshire, a place I've never been and am not sure it exists. But in the dream Manchester was sort of like a benign version of the video game _Half-Life 2_, with no Overwatch chasing and beating you, but you could move with ease in water or on land. You could swim places if it was faster. Manchester itself was a small cosmopolitan city, with nice Japanese-style convenience stores that sold everything and were an acceptable place to hang out, but with little in the way of a rock and roll scene. I was excited that I'd be in the forefront of changing that.

The dream did not extend so far as me taking any classes or getting housing or anything, but I'm fine with that. It's rare -- singular -- that I have a dream that isn't at least a little bit scary or depressing. This was just fun and exciting. I wish it were real, even if it were as far away from me as New Hampshire.
