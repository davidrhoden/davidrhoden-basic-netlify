I dreamed I went to New York City with my cat Buddy, and also a kitten that looked like a miniature Buddy. I was traveling with some kind of group in a fifteen-passenger bus, and I felt OK leaving the cats in it, but sometimes I wanted to bring them with me. I went to a nice but struggling Japanese stationery shop, bought some stuff, then took the cats to eat at a "dairy" type Kosher restaurant. I kept feeling like I was going to forget them or lose them, but they were loyal and stayed where I put them. It was fun sitting in a restaurant with a tabby kitten, watching it eat dream food.

Pretty nice dream. I should note I'm sick as can be, on day seven of this. This was probably a "fever dream".
