I dreamed I watched a tense and scary Steve McQueen movie (though I'm not sure it was Steve McQueen. It wasn't Roy Scheider though). The plot required him to time it just right so that as the subway train he was on came into the station, he had to shoot a man on the platform who was about to come on the train and arrest him. He succeeded, and so the train continued on with a big hole in the window.

The rest of the movie was about a prison, and I was in it. The prison was really dull, there were big meeting rooms, big enough for a large group of people to eat in, sort of like a church might have. I was released to go to the mall, and I went to an incredible bookstore that had so many computer books. I looked at a book where the illustrations were animated, to show you how the software it covered worked. I bought the book, but as soon as I did, I took it to a table in the food court to look at it, and it had boogers on so many pages.
