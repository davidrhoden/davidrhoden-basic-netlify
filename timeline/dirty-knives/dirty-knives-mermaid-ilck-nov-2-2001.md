I broke three strings on the first song and I didn't have a working spare, so it was back to the old school style for yours truly. I just sang and let the band do the hard work like they always do. Shaun played great in his stage debut.

We had a new drummer for this show. I regret that decision. Not because I didn't like our new drummer (Shawn Washburn), or didn't think he was good. I just felt like we should have kept on with Dan. I feel like asking him to leave hurt our friendship, and that we lost a really creative artist and musician.

Immortal Lee County Killers' drummer J.R.R. Tokin' used his floor tom strictly as a coffee table. He had his ashtray, his booze, and I think a little lamp on it.

Hazzard County Girls and Rocket 350 also played on this bill.
