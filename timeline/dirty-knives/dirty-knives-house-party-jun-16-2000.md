 We played a house party near UNO. This was the last gig for Marcus, who had to go up north for the summer to work at a Renaissance Fair. He would be replaced by Talbot Adams. This was a fun gig because there were no cops, there was a keg, and we played "Jailhouse Rock" in a manner similar to that of ZZ Top on the _Fandango_ album without ever having rehearsed it.
