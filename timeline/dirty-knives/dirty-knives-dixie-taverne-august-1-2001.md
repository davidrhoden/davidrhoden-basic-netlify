Dixie Taverne (New Orleans) with [Bright Calm Blue](http://www.brightcalmblue.com), and [To Dream Of Autumn](http://www.todreamofautumn.com)
We only had one new song ("Heading For The Texas Border") which we didn't even write, but since this was a new venue and a new crowd for us, what's the difference? We played really hard and loud - Sara's amp was hot enough to fry a dog's brain. I liked us! The audience was very *serious*- at one point I whispered "everybody dance" in the mike, like Corky in *Waiting for Guffman*, and four or five dudes *walked out of the room*. I saw some devil horns though, and they clapped real loud.

The other bands were "screamo" bands, which is a kind of "emo" which is a kind of musical genre...I'm not really sure what it is. Bright Calm Blue came on and just wiped the floor with us - total volume and chops. the screaming was absolutely unintelligible. I liked it!

One not-very-amusing thing hapened at this show. Two cops came in, maybe because of a noise complaint. They looked like they were ready to shut the show down, but instead they asked the doorman to accompany hem to the office and bring the cash box with him. When he came out he was holding the box down at his side, obviously empty. He just shrugged. And the cops left.
