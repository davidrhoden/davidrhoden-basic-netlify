I saw Star Wars in the theater at age 10. My mom had given me my Dad's TIME magazine, with Star Wars on the cover, saying, "I think this issue is for you," so I had a print preview.

I said to the rest of the kids in the neighborhood: "I think they can move and shoot at the same time in this," something we felt was sadly missing from our favorite show, Star Trek.
