Was this the show where I left my amp at Freddy's and went back the next day to get it and they (Anna Copacabana in particular) acted like I didn't deserve to have it? I guess I didn't. 

I'm not sure when that happened.

I like those green drums, wish that were my kit. I still have that snare, somehow.

This show was well attended, but then Chan started into "Fiesta" (The Pogues tune), and the place _really_ filled up.
