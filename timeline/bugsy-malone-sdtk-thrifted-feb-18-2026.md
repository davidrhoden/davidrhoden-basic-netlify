![cover of Bugsy Malone soundtrack on vinyl, found at thrift store in New Orleans La](/static/img/timeline/bugsy-malone-thrifted-feb-18-2026.jpg)

I played the grooves off of this as a kid.

We loved the movie. I thought the kid actors were really singing these songs, and these were their voices.
Was I already in love with Jodie Foster from _Freaky Friday_ (I think I saw that first?), or did I see this first, and _Freaky Friday_ sealed the deal?

I could write so much more about this, and I hope I will.

Condition of the vinyl is excellent. No custom inner sleeve (did it have one?) but the sleeve with it is o.k. Sleeve is very good; no writing, no kid smells.
I'd give this a VG+ on Discogs.
