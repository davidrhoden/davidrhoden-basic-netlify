This wasn't too tough of a hurricane to sit through. I had a nifty power supply, borrowed from an out-of-town friend, so I watched movies on my laptop.
"Analyze This" and "Citizen Ruth". They were both good. DeNiro is funny if the part is written funny, which this was, I thought. (Kenneth Lonergan was one of the screenwriters; this was probably a money job for him, but that's fine.) "Citizen Ruth" is Alexander Payne's directorial debut. Laura Dern is funny in it as a drug-seeking woman who is offered money by pro-lifers not to kill her baby, and then by pro-choicers who want to pay her to go through with it. It's a comedy.
