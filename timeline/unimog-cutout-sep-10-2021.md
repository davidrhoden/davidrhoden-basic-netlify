I took a picture of this wonder truck in Chattanooga last Thanksgiving. It's a Unimog, a Mercedes-Benz product with four-wheel independent suspension, these things can climb mountains.  Meant to paint a picture of it then, finally getting around to it now. Trey took a picture of it last week when we were in Chattanooga,  don't think it has moved.

Bonus Buddy pics, as he was being cute.
