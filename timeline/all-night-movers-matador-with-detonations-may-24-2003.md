I liked the Detonations. I did a website for them back in the day, I even made a custom font for it. It probably wasn't very good. I was in law school at the time. I remember I had a little meeting with John Henry about the website and he called me "duder." I wasn't sure what that meant.

I went for a walk before the show. Sorry about the tiny pictures, I had only bad cameras then.
