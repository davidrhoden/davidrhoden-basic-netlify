This was the show where Heather Weathers wore a meat bikini and cooked it, in pieces, on a hot plate while wearing an apron, or nothing, and Susan Roesgen was trying to get somebody to say something bad about it.

Also I think this is the show where some dope playing bongos insisted on sitting in with us. That was a bad decision on his part.
