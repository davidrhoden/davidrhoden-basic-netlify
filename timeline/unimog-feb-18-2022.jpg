I spent too long on it but happy it's done. The longer I worked on it the simpler I made it.

Also, if you've never seen a Unimog in action look it up. It doesn't have axles; all four wheels have independent suspension so it can climb up river rapids and such. 

I want to come back as a Unimog if that can be arranged.
