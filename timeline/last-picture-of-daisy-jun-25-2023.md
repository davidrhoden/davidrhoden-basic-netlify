We would go on walks and I would give her quarter-pound balls of hamburger meat. She loved it so much. When we got to the spot on our walks where I usually gave her the treats, she would start to jump up and down, not like she was trying to get anything, it was just excitement.

In this picture, she's looking at me like, "got any more of that hamburger meat?"
