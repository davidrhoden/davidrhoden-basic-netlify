I've been disturbing this possum nightly all week as he or she goes about the business of eating bugs and such in my yard, but tonight it decided to come bug me instead. I thought I heard Buddy having a snack but it was this interloper. I had to move about every piece of shelving and cabinetry in the kitchen and it still woudn't leave until I gently tapped it with a broom. It was so blind it ran past one wide open door before homing in on the other one.
