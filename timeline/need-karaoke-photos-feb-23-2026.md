Do you have pictures of your friends or you doing karaoke? I need one, or some, for the cover of my next Karaoke Cartoons fanzine.
The reward is: a great deal of recognition. Oh, sure, free copies, all you want! But I give them away to strangers for nothing, so, you know, that's easy.

So if you have an amusing or otherwise poignant photo of you or a loved one or a hated one doing karaoke, send it to me. You'll have my eternal gratitude plus something in the mail.
