I was so precious with my flyer making.

Across the Yard was good, they were friends of ours. They were very jangly, but who wasn't back then. It was taken for granted. I think now they were probably highly influenced by the Miracle Legion record _The Backyard_, consciously or unconsciously (we were too).
