Our band Everything Tool played China King on the Cumberland Avenue strip a lot. It was a fun gig. If you got there early enough Mr. and Mrs. Liu would feed you a big family-syle dinner, though this wasn't always a good thing. Once they were handing out the egg rolls and they said "Take two! Take two!" I did, and on that occasion I regretted it. I think that was the same day Mr. Liu came up to my housemate, Ed, and asked him to translate something in his Refrigeration textbook.

Across the Yard was good, they were friends of ours. They were very jangly, but who wasn't back then. It was taken for granted. I think now they were probably highly influenced by the Miracle Legion record _The Backyard_, consciously or unconsciously (we were too).
