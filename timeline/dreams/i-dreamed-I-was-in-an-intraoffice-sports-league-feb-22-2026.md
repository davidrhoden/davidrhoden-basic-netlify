I slept late and dreamed I was part of an unofficial sports in the corporate workplace scheme and I was the most knowledgeable about it so I had to answer mail and keep secrets (and sometimes share secrets) but it never became clear what the sport was.

In the dream the sport could be negatively affected if the company had a history of heavy trucks unloading at their facility. It had more rules and lore than baseball. It was tiring; I kept trying to get up.

I also made it to Queen Bee. The last two times I've played, the last word I found was the name of a shape of pasta.
