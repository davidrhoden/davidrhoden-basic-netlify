We got serious snow in New Orleans, some people got a foot. I'd say my yard and my neighborhood got six inches.

I let Buddy out in it and he didn't know what to make of it--but rather than me tell you about it, please enjoy this film that I call "Two Minutes of Buddy's First Snow". In all likelihood, it's also his last snow, so long as he and/or I stay(s) in balmy New Orleans, but who really knows?
