When I worked at Cat's Records (1985 or so) many, many people asked when the new Slick Rick was coming out. But I think he was in jail. It never came out while I worked there. Same thing happened with Doug E. Fresh. Every day at least one person would ask if we had the new Doug E. Frash. As far as I know, it never did.

Anyway, this song might be kind of obscure now. I didn't even know about it at the time. But it's called "Children's Story" by Slick Rick, and if you don't know it I recommend giving it a listen.
