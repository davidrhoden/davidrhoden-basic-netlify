Thanks to an invitation from my friend [Pam Jorden](https://www.pamelajorden.com/), I got to visit the studio that animated the first season of _The Simpsons_ (ythough maybe not all that successfully) and shows like _The Wild Thornberrys_.

I actually showed them my 60-second reel. They were encouraging.
