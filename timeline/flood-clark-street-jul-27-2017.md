My neighbor, a nice guy I didn't know well, came in my open door to wake me up from my nap so I could move my truck.
I managed to get it a little higher but the interior still flooded.

I think this was the same flood where I couldn't find Sally and I actually swam under the house looking for her. She was in the shed the whole time. Once she got hungry she bounded through the water to get inside with me. that was an awful wait.
