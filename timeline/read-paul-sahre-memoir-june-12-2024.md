Fun but also dramatic memoir by a guy about my age who made himself a good reputation as a graphic designer, but who also had some petty fights and gripes that I really liked reading about. If I had known you could write about that, I'd have written a couple of memoirs by now. I loved the part where he was designing a cover for the Steely Dan album "Two Against Nature", and he listened to their suggestions, then told them to fuck off. They didn't use the cover he designed.
