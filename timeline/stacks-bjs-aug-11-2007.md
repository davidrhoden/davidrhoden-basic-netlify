![Uptown Music Exchange, a.k.a. Jimmy's, where I bought a guitar the day of the show.](/static/img/timeline/uptown-music-exchange-aug-11-2007.jpg)

Came to New Orleans for the weekend and somehow got a gig.
The Stacks play tonight at BJ's, corner of Burgundy and Lesseps.
I had to buy a plane ticket and a guitar for this show...

I bought the guitar at Jimmy's Uptown music Exchange.
I had turned this guitar down so many times.
Any time I'd ask Jimmy if he had any lefties it was always this one: n"Austin" brand Strat knock-off.
But this time I had no choice.
He only charged me $75 for it. Thanks, Jimmy.
