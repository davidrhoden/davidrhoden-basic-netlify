I don't have real specific memories from this show, but it does remind me of something I saw at the Lucky Cat on an unknown date (so I'll drop it here).

I was alking by and three workmen were standing outside looking at something happening behind the glass front door. I joined them out of curiosity. I could see stars of broken glass appearing on the door. Inside, a shortish guy was holding another bigger man around the chest and using his head as a battering ram. He was methodically smashing the door up and saying to the guy: "Stop. Fucking. My. Wife. Stop. Fucking. My. Wife." The battering ram seemed to acknowledge that he deserved this treatment. Quite a scene.
