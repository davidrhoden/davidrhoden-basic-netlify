I also did this cartoon. I drew the man in the sweater first, thinking he'd be singing the "It's Only Rock and Roll" lyrics, but he didn't seem quite right. I decided to just turn on the radio and draw the next funny lyric I heard. I hope this one was funny enough. I forgot who the group was (Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds).
