I drew a cartoon based on "The Sound of Silence" on [January 5, 2026](/timeline/cartooned-a-woman-in-seasonally-appropriate-clothing-depressing-everybody-at-a-party/), and, as I drew it, I wondered if I'd maybe already done one based on that song. Then later in the day I opened a dusty plastic container of gouache paints, and in it were two old karaoke cartoons, including this one.
