I went by Anthony Del Rosario's gallery on Magazine Street, Nola 'Nacular, to see a show by a Los Angeles artist, Megan Whitmarsh. (She used to live here.)
The show was called "In The Year 2525", after the very bad Zager and Evans song. The work was great--whimsical defamiliarizations of things we see every day, but in a far-off imagined future. Everybody got a weird news paper with strange fake ads for things like cave real estate. In the corner was a very Oldenburgian pile of crafted trash.

I saw so many people who were important in my life when I got to town, people who came to me and Sara's wedding, but whom I rarely see anymore. We've all retired to our homes, I suppose. I guess they all knew Megan Whitmarsh back when. I've come and gone but they all stayed here. I wonder if I seem just like a partly forgotten memory to them.
