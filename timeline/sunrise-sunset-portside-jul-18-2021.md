Went to Creepy Fest, a place I probably didn't really belong,, but I had a good time just the same. Saw my friends Tom, Ray, and Jay play. I played in a band a long time back with Tom, and he was also in the Stacks (playing keyboards) for a while.

I think I need to credit these pictures, though I think I took the set list one.
