We played so well at this show and Dex was great too. Unfortunately the club promoted the show not at all, and neither did I for some reason. We may have been a late addition to the bill (added in hopes we would promote the show, I bet). He was very unsocial (not a surprise) and sat in his car pounding Bucklers most of the evening. The drummer was very friendly. They were touring for their album _Chased By Martians_, which I remember had a nice cover of "The Seeker".

The Hi-Ho was a weird club at this time. It seemed like nobody was running it. There was nobody to ask about anything. The sound kind of did itself.
