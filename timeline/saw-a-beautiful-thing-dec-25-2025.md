This is what I saw earlier: Driving to my friend's place to feed her cats, I saw a man on St. Roch avenue, near St. Claude. Older black guy but not old-old. Honestly, maybe my age. He was pushing a yellow Dollar General shopping cart full of unidentifiable junk. But he had a cat with him! a bigger version of the Buddy model, just a real big boy. And the man picked the cat up off the street and gave him a gentle little toss in the air, and then just held him up and admired him, talking to him, while the cat showed no change of expression. Just a big satisfied tiger.
