We got asked to play an art gallery openeing, something I don't recommend. It was so loud and reverberative in the gallery, even I couldn't tolerate it, but the gallery had a big front window, so we just moved our gear out onto Carondelet Strett and played there. One of the funnest gigs I can remember.
