![mailer for David Rhoden art show at Maiden Brooklyn gallery](/static/img/timeline/showcard-aug-3-2006.gif "mailer for David Rhoden art show at Maiden Brooklyn gallery")

This is a mailer I made for a show I had at a gallery on Grand Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 2006. It was an amazing show. A band called O Death played in the basement. It was terribly hot but I drank a lot of cold beer. Julia Rogers bought me a falafel.

I don't have a single picture from it! If you have one, would you <a href="mailto:david@davidrhoden.com&subject=Dave, I have pictures from your Maiden Brooklyn show">e-mail me</a>?
