![flyers for a rock show: Stacks and Sutures, Octovber 8, 2004.](/static/img/rock/stacks/stacks-flyer-sutures-oct-8-2004.jpg)

We kinda liked Lounge Lizards, though it had a weird sideways layout, where the bar was on the left wall as you went in, and the band was on the right. It was across the street from the House of Blues club on Decatur. Not sure what's there now. It had an upstairs dressing room for the bands! 

 I'm sorry, I don't remember The Sutures at all. I don't know if they were local or from out of town.

 I do wonder if this is the gig where the band (minus me) played an encore of "Tequila" and Chan fell off the front of the stage.
