I don't remember this gig being a big success. I don't think people were very ready for happy Hour shows at the Mermaid.
But I don't remember it being a big failure either.

Black Bonnets were Andrew Donaldson, Elizabeth Underwood, and Ginger Parsons. Ihad actually played a show with Andrew back in about 1987 but we didn't really meet then. I got to be friends with Andrew in New Orleans. I met Elizabeth at Andrew and Marny's wedding and she and I were a couple for a while. Ginger and Elizabeth were next door neighbors Uptown in these old creole cottages that almost had dirt floors. Very historical.
