Not much memory of this but here's what I wrote on Facebook:

"Thanks to everybody who came out to see the Stacks at Circle Bar last night! It was a nice crowd, kinda weird to be back there after so long away. Thanks also for bearing with us as we struggled through a Jimmy Webb cover; I think we made it through mostly uninjured."
