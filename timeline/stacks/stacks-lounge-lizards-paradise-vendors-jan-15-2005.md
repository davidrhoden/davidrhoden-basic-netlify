I'm sure this was a fine show for us, I'd rather mention Paradise Vendors. They really didn't sound like anybody else, hard to even assign them to a genre. The singer, Jeanne Stallworth, was always a friend since I met her, and Dave Baker and Elzy Lindsay were also among the friendlier musicians in town. They weren't people who skulked around in barrooms like I did, so I mostly talked to them at shows but my impression then and now was"these are good people".
