Me and Trey were in garbage moods, me especially, so we drove to Mississippi, where it was just Tuesday, in the sleet and snow. We went to a barbecue place, then we just drove around. I think we listened to _Don't Touch That Dwarf, Hand Me The Pliers_. We found and commemorated this Bourbon Street in some little Louisiana town. Photo by Trey.
