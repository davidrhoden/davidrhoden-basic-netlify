I got kicked out of a record store once. I was 16 (recently licensed), my brother was 14. We went to Record Bar in the mall.
And the employees were playing Buckner & Garcia's "Pac-Man Fever" for some reason. And not the single, the album, with all those deep cuts you remember. Anyway, it was annoying as hell. It had gotten to "Go Froggy Go" and the clerk was away from the desk, so, without saying anything, I walked back there and took the needle off. Of course the guy flipped out and "banned" me "for life" and we didn't get to buy any records. Definitely worth it though.
