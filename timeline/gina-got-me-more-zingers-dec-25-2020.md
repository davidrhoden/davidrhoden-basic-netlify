A few years ago, my band All-Night Movers played some shows in the New York area and we stayed in Jersey City with our friend Tony Arrieta. I woke up first and was looking for something to read. In a chest full of literature, I found a little paperback called _More Zingers From The Hollywood Squares_. "Whatever," I reasoned, and started to read.

Minutes later I was gasping for air, holding my sides, trying not to wake the household. The Zingers had gotten to me.

I told Gina about this peculiar morning, many times, I guess. Because this Christmas, there it was, under the tree: _More Zingers_.

I love it and I love Gina.
