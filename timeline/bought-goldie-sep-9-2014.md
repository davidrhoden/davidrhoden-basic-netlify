I paid $600 plus a painting, so depending on how you value the painting I paid $800 or $1000 for the truck.

I had to clean a literal ttruckload of networking gear out of the bed so i could move my stuff in it. it was still a great deal.

I still have it in 2020, running well, though a lot of repair has gone into it. Also about 30,000 miles.
