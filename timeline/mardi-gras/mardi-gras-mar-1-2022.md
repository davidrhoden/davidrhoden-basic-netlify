I didn't even go out last year. I didn't make a costume this year, I just recycled my 2017 doodled-on Tyvek suit (and Gina added a ridiculous white wig). She reprised her FOAM-O look with a crazy wig made of Great Stuff and the name "No' Mo' FOMO".

I tripped while exiting a classy bar called The John and pretty quickly realized I was injured. I was also impaired in other ways. Gina got the vanand picked me up, and I went to her house and slept for six hours.
