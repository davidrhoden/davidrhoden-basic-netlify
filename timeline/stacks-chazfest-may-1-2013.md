The Stacks played the 8th Annual Chazfest, in the yard of what was known as the Truck Farm, on St. Claude Avenue. We opened the show, so it was "crack a PBR and hit the stage at noon". I remember it was supposed to rain but didn't. I got a good compliment. Chazfest was in between the weekends of Jazz Fest, so a lot of "festers" came. This one white-haired guy with Tevas on said, "You guys reminded my of the early Rolling Stones, and I saw them several times!"

Chaz Fest was a fun gig. Fun to play, fun to attend. The ticket price seemed astronomical but it was really fair (regular weekend rock shows would cost $20 if life were fair to musicians). It was tied for the best paying gig I ever played actually. Also, I believe, in all the years they did it, that Chaz Fest never hired a single security person.
