I got a Wacom Cintiq tablet, you draw right on the screen.

I got this great new drawing tool. It’s actually old, and I got it super-cheap, cause it isn’t anything like new, but it was basically 75% off, so I went for it.

Look at the wonderful stuff I’ve done with it so far (in Adobe Illustrator).
