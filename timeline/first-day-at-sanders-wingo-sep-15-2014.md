I was still looking for an apartment. I ended up staying at Motel 6 for about a month. It was great while I had a room on the back of the building, on the ground. Much less so when they moved me to the front, facing the interstate, and the second floor.

I didn't want to move my truck as it was still pretty loaded so I biked to work.
