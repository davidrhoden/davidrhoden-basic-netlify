I was driving to Chattanooga in my 1994 Nissan XTerra. I was getting close to Birmingham when I started to hear a ticking sound coming from the right side of the motor. I pulled over and looked at the running motor. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so I just decided to drive on. A minute after I got back on the highway I started to lose power. Thankfully there was another exit close, less than a mile. Unfortunately, it was rush hour and I got in kind of a traffic jam.  I had to floor it to get any speed at all, but I parked it in a parking lot.

An oldish lady who was taling to her daughter asked me "what's wrong witho your car?" I said I didn't really know but it was something. I described the symptoms. She said "Sounds like you ran out of oil. Put a quart of oil in it, it'll be all right." (Notice how I had the hood up at the last stop. Did I check the oil then? NO. What an idiot.) I put in two and it did sound better, but I had already called AAA. The tow driver was patient as I considered whether to just drive on, but then he pushed down on the throttle cables, revving the engine and revealing a serious issue.

"Hear that knocking? That's your rods bottoming out." (Forgive me if I don't transcribe his words exactly right. He thought he was talking to a car guy.)

"Should I drive it, then?" I saked, hopefully, and obliviously.

"You can drive it till it breaks down again, and call another tow truck from there." So, never mind, in other words.

The driver took me to a closed shop in McCalla, Alabama. But he asked "You have AAA Gold, right?" I did, so he said "Theyll tow you up to a hungred miles. If you're tryiing to get to Chattanooga, why not take it further up the road? Just call AAA, they won't care." SO I called AAA and got a tow to Gadsden, which is close enough to Chattanooga that my mom and her friend Michael (a college-aged guy that lives in her building) could drive down to get me.
