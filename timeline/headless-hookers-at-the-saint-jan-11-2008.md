Headless Hookers play this Friday night at The Saint, on St. Ann Street in New Orleans, Louisiana. I will be there playing the drums.

This show went great, but I cut the hell out of my shin on the edge of a cymbal. I was wearing a suit, and you couldn't see it, but was pretty bloody. Also, I had to fly back pretty early the next morning, and I didn't really ven have a place to stay, so I stayed out all night at The Saint, Talking with Matt Uhlman, until we walked out into the light. I took a cab to the Bluebird Cafe to get breakfast and they weren't even open. I got on the plane, seat 1F. Still wearing my smoky suit. The guy next to be was a real healthy blond guy. The flight attendant said to him "oh, you requested the vegetarian meal, right? We'll have that right out for you." So she brought me some scrambled eggs and a sausage link, and she hands this guy the biggest fruit salad you ever saw. It had health and light radiating out of it.

I didn't get to clean all the blood off my shin until I got back to Brooklyn, hours later.
