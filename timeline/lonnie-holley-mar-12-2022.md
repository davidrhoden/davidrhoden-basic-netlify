We walked over the St. Claude bridge to see Lonnie Holley at the Music Box Village. It was a neat show. The Music Box Village is a little bit corporate-funded-grant-moneyish (as opposed to something like Howard Finster's Summerville compound), but it's pretty cool nevertheless. We sneaked our own booze in which saved some dough. Lonnie Holley just improvises on whatever subjects cross his mind, and he's actually good at doing it. Kind of like a preacher. I'm glad we went.
