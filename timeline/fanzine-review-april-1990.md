Here's what [_Factsheet Five_ #35](https://archive.org/details/factsheet_five_35) wrote about my publication, _35th Parallel_:

35TH PARALLEL #2 ($1 from David Rhoden, 1634 Laurel #1, Knoxville, TN 37916): 
Well, mostly music here, along with some comics and a review of a funny companion to dry as dust English literature classics. Mostly this is David going on about favorite records and groups. Giant Sand, Sebadoh, State of the Union, and more. A personal view of the music scene. (S-12) 

That address must be from when I roomed with Alex Williamson.
