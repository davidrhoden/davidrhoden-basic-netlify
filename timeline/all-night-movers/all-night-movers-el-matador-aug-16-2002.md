![Zoom, though not really from 2002.](/static/img/timeline/zoom-though-not-from-aug-16-2002.png)

I actually had to stop and put on a string or two. Settly from Zoom told me that was very unprofessional. I kind of knew that already though.

A recording of the show does exist though I bet it's only of interest to me, and maybe not even to me.
