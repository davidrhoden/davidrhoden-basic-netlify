I don't remember the show too much. I do remember Mondo Topless was staying at my place and I rode in their van with them and we went to Chicken Box, which they were amazed at. Poor Sam, the lead singer, had gone vegetarian and had to eat food out of his electric cooler while the rest of us had a feast.

I was always friendly with these guys, saw them a lot in New York. Somehow Kris and I got in a Facebook argument and aren't friends anymore. I don't remember what happened. I hope I can fix that someday.
