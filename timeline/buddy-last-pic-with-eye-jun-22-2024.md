This was so sad, and a dreadful time for us. Well, for me anyway. Buddy had to go for a bunch of vet visits, he didn't love that, but he's really good in the car and at the vet. At first the vet said she didn't see anything wrong, and she thought he could keep his eye. But the test for glaucoma indicated very high pressure in his eye, that was certainly causing him pain. So we made the decision to have Dr. daCosta remove the eye.

I didn't think of it at the time, but this was the last picture of Buddy with his left eye.
