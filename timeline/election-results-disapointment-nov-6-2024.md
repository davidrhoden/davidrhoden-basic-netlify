title: I'm very disappointed about the election, and how the media lied to us and made us think Harris had a chance.

I don't want to talk a lot about the election, but I thought there was supposed to be this huge wave of enthusiasm and GOTV and women were going to vote in huge numbers, far outpacing the men. But Kamala Harris & Tim Walz got almost fifteen million fewer votes than Biden did. (Donald Trump got about 2 million votes fewer than he did last time.)

People just didn't show up to the polls. Those long lines we saw here and there were mostly Trump voters.

No media got this right. They were still talking about massive turnout into last night. But the turnout was bad. All the enthusiasm we saw for KH/TW was because we were watching and listening to selective reporting. Basically, we got lied to.

I'd like to thnk we'll hear tomorrow that the Trump team, with the help of Musk and Putin, somehow rigged votes to change from blue to red, but we won't.
