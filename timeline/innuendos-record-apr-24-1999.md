We recorded down in the basement and while we were recording the home heating oil got delivered. Somehow the oil leaked and soaked Joe's drum cases. I brought them to my house, for some reason but they were so noxious and unsalvageable Sara made me throw them out. She was right to do that. I'm sorry.
