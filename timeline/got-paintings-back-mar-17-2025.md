I got a surprise Facebook Messenger message today. It was from someone who curated an art show (at Kebab, a super kebab place on St. Claude Avenue in New Orleans, much missed) back in 2014, right before I moved to Austin. I had the work in the show, and I didn't have time to get it before moving. I had to be in Austin on a certain day to start work, and the show was still up. I couldn't get anyone to pick up the work for me, so I just told the curator she could have the paintings and do whatever she wanted with them.

Today she said she was moving and downsizing, and asked if I would like to take the work back. Eleven years later! I was thrilled to get them back. I drove over to her house (which I loved, it felt like how New Orleans was before the deluge, unchanged). They were in perfect shape, well cared for.

It's interesting to see how carefully I painted things then. I felt like I had more time left.
