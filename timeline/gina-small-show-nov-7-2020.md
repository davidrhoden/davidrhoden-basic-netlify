![Gina was part of a small show at Jonathan Ferrara Gallery.](/static/img/gina/gina-small-show-nov-7-2020.jpg "Gina was part of a small show at Jonathan Ferrara Gallery.")

Gina was part of a show at Jonathan Ferrara Gallery on Julia Street in New Orleans with a few other artists the gallery features. It was a lovely show. It's still too soon for big gatherings, so it's fine if you couldn't make it. The crowd was small, on purpose.

I'm excited about Gina's new work. She's having a bigger show at the gallery in February.
