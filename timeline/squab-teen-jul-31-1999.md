I went to a CD release for my Bent Media co-worker Austin Luminais' two-piece group, Squab Teen.

It was Austin playing synths and a surprisingly pretty woman who sang. (We didn't know if Austin knew any women.) Never very sociable, Austin came out of his shell a bit for this Mermaid Lounge performance. Not only did he play synths, he also opened up a can of vienna sausages, and gently poked his musical partner on the cheek with them. It was transgressive.
