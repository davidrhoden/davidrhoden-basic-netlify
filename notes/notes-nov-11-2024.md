11/11 is Betty's gotcha day. I'll have to think about the year, but it was in the late nineties. I've written some about Betty on this site (see ["all posts tagged 'Betty'"](/tags/betty/)), so I won't repeat those, but I was thinking about her a lot today. She only lived to be about ten (she had diabetes) but most of that was lived with me, and then my mom after Katrina. I throught about bringing her back to Brooklyn, (her birthplace) when I got settled after Katrina, but by then she and my mom had bonded. Betty would always greet me when I walked through the door at my mother's place, but then she would go back to her regular spot on the arm of the couch where my mom sat to watch TV and do crosswords. She looked happy there, so I decided she should stay.

She was one of the most dignified cats I've ever known, so it was funny when she would have undignified things happen to her.
