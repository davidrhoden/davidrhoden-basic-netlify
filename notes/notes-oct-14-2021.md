I thought "Small Victories" was one of the best Lemon Twigs songs, then I heard this version of "The Fire". The singer is embarrassing to watch, I don't know what to say about his posture, but also he's GREAT. Both guitar players tear it up (as does the rest of the band). I hardly ever see anything like this.

"The Fire" starts at 4:10 but I don't recommend skipping.
