Autocorrect just changed my invoice. Instead of billing for a conversation about ‘query caching’, I billed for ‘queer coaching’.
I caught it but I wonder what the invoice payer would have thought we were doing on this website. 
Do they not understand I don’t look at the screen when I type? Eyes firmly fixed on the keyboard.

Also, Stacks have a show this weekend.

# Next show: Saturday, June 15, 2024, at Pirogue's Whiskey Bayou in Arabi, Louisiana. No cover, two sets. 8 - 10 p.m. SHARP.

And while I'm thinking about it, would you please join our mailing list? I promise to never let you miss another show.
