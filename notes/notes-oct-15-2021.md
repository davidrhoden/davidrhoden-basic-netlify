Gina took this picture of. map of my neighborhood in 1893 while researching lot boundaries for her studio project. Interesting to me, there was a stable out back, and some kind of shed at what's now the end of the driveway. Actually more interesting are the street name changes. I wonder why that happened. Pontalba is now Alhambra Street, and Hancock is St. Maurice.

I looked in the book _Frenchmen, Desire, Good Children_, a pop history of anecdotes about the naming of New Orleans streets, hopinf for an explanation. Alas, the story isn't that interesting:
