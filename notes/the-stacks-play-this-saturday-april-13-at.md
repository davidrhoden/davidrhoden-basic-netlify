Hello, Dear Dave Rhoden's Computer Newsletter subscriber! Just a few bits of news:

[The Stacks](https://thestackswebsite.com) (my band, or a band with me in it) are playing this Saturday, April 13, 2024, at Checkpoint Charlie, with [Happy Talk Band](https://lukespurrallen.com). Show at 9 p.m. We play in the French Quarter once a decade or less, so please don't miss it.

Also, you can follow [The Stacks on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thestacksnola) to get these important announcements the moment they happen.

In other Dave Rhoden news, I compiled a little booklet of my _karaoke_ cartoons that you may have already seen on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thedavidrhoden/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/davidrhoden/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidrhoden).

THey're just drawings of people singing karaoke songs into a home karaoke-type machine. Your job is to I.D. the songs from the quoted excerpts. (There's an answer key on the back cover.)

It's 24 pages, staple-bound. Laser printed on, let's see... 20lb copy paper. Good stuff. It's black-and-white, but so are the originals.

I'd love to send you one. If you want one, just email me your mailing address. If you want to get money involved, you can Venmo me an amount not to exceed four dollars at [@davidrhoden](https://venmo.com/u/davidrhoden). (If you're curious, the minimum transaction on Venmo is $0.01. And a "FOREVER" postage stamp costs 68 cents these days, did you know that? I was shocked.)

I've got a few recent paintings to sell as well.
Here's a karaoke-based one (the lyric is from the theme song to _Grease_).

If you're like me and you enjoy paintings of industrial equipment, you'll love hanging this painting of a forklift on your wall.

There are a bunch of other paintings for sale at [This Is My Happening](https://thisismyhappening.com), my online "storefront".

Jeeze, what else? I'm sure there's something, but this is plenty.

Please reply to this email with your movie and book suggestions, I'd love to hear them.

Also do me a favor and forward this newsletter to anybody you know who would benefit from it, which is practically everybody. Really spam 'em good.

That's all for this time! Thanks for subscribing,  
Sincerely, Dave
