If you ever hear me grumbling about not being able to find my reading glasses, remind me I found three pairs under the head of my bed this morning.

-----

_Greeting from Asbury Park N.J_ is a top-notch Bruce Springsteen album, especially if you consider how new his voice was when the ablum came out. Nothing like it. It's great top to bottom.

Except for "Mary, Queen of Arkansas". Bruce, what were you thinking? Surely you had something else on tape. Did you need the art-cred that bad?

-----

Still soft-boycotting NPR and boycotting _The New York Times_ altogether. As soon as they day after the election, they started giving us their expert opinions on why the Harris campaign failed. But, why is that news now, and not _before_ the election? I fyou knew so much  about the American people, why not write it before the election, and save us all the trouble of voting. I just can't stand to listen to the news or read it right now.

-----

I deactivated my Twitter, but I'm thinking about reactivating it. IMy twitter account is my name ([davidrhoden](https://www.twitter.com/ddvidrhoden)), and I understand deactivated names can be given out again, almost certainly to bots. I'd like to avoid that as long as I'm alive.

-----

Did I dream that I mansplained Alvin Kamara's salary structure to someone, or did I really do that? I'm going to go with "I dreamed it", because I don't know anything about Alvin Kamara's salary, really.

(But in general, running backs get paid less than other stars because they are more replaceable.)
