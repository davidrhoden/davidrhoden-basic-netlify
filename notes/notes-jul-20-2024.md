I saw William Shakespeare's _Julius Caesar_ last night on the Tulane campus. I thought it was good. I felt like some of the lines (Brutus and Cassius' dialogues) were delivered too seriously, too passionately, like they were words of the utmost seriousness, but as I listened to them, using my little powers of reading comprehension, I felt like they should be delivered more like witty banter. I feel like the story isn't meant to be taken entirely seriously. I need to get a copy and find the passages I'm talking about. Maybe my way of interpreting it turns it too much into a comedy. But there are comic elements that I felt like they missed.

On the other hand, I liked the comic relief character (Decius, played by Ryan Hayes), he seemed to get it right, and we were amazed by James Bartelle as Marc Antony. He read the part for maximum ironic impact, like how I imagine Dave Chapelle or maybe Richard Pryor would read it. Sometimes actors in Shakespeare seem to struggle with the language, like they are really just trying to remember their lines, and the meaning gets lost. This Marc Antony was quite the opposite. Every line stuck the landing. It made you understand why the "I have come to praise Caesar, not to bury him" is still so famous.

Buddy's eye incision has scabbed over, which is what the eye surgeon told me to watch for. That's what you want.

Last and probably least:

Somebody on the HC Neighbors (Holy Cross) Facebook group was asking for something like a plastic campaign sign to make a makeshift stop sign out of, for the corner of Andry and Burgundy, where the city-issued one disappeared. I suggested I would make one out of plywood, as I had a sort of water-affected piece I could spare. She said that'd be great, and could I also make a 311 request about it? So I started cutting, sanding, and priming on Friday, and I started painting this morning (Saturday) but I looked at Facebook and it turns out the city replaced the sign.

So now I've got this ridiculous thing. Well, it's ridiculous unless somebody wants it. I'll accept any reasonable offer.
