I hardly have any news. I've seen some good movies. Maurice Pialat's _Ã€ nos amours_ was a good one.
I also have been enjoying the TV show _Reservation Dogs_.

Oh wait, there is one thing: [The Stacks](https://thestackswebsite.com) are playing on Saturday at Pirogue's Whiskey Bayou. We'll have Chan with us again. Also, it's billed as a Hallowe'en Party (but don't let that stop you). I hear they are handing out a free drink if you come dressed as Super Dave. I maybe be able to swing that.
