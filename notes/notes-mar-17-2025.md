So now the current regime has started to send people to concentration camps in El Salvador without due process. This is analogous\* to Nazi Germany's sending Jews and other people disfavored by the regime to the concentration camps.
We are reliving the worst of history. The news barely acknowledges it. And I admit, I don't know what to do either.

Oh, they have tattoos? Should we just _kill_ them then? Will you do it?
