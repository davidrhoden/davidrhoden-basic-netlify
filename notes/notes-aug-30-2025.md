description: 'I heard this song on the radio; my first thought was "oh this is some kind of world music," with the not-in-English chanting (and because I was listening to Trans-Pacific Sound Paradise, the "world music" show on WFMU), but I was just as quickly captivated by it. Captivated, I say, though I wasn''t sure I "liked" it. When it was over on the radio, I looked up The Burns Unit''s "Send Them Kids To War" on the internet and found this video of the band doing the song live. I have to ask: how do you rehearse something like that? It creates energy but it seems like it would be draining to get your point across in this way, and then have to do it again. But, obviously, rehearse it they did. Like, once you know it, it''s probably very rewarding to run through it, but learning it must be a hell of a job."'
