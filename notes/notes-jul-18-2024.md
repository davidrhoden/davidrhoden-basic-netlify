"I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'."
*--Bob Newhart*

Bob Newhart made it to 94, still doing well from what I could see. Still, a hero is gone. He's one person I can think of who really did great work in the medium of television, it was really perfect for his kind of comedy. The shows he did were half-hour sitcoms but they wouldn't have worked without him.

So, I have an iPhone, and I also have Google Photos, and Apple Photos on iCloud. That's probably too much backup, I know. But anyway: when I plug my phone in it seems like Google Photos and Apple Photos are fighting to store my pictures. I would think they'd both be the same, but they're not. In particular my Apple Photos don't appear to my desktop until I plug it in, but they're on Google Photos right away.

Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong? Should I just get rid of one of these storage methods? I don't like having to look in both places for my snaps.

Buddy's still recovering from his eye removal. His incision's really still too red for my comfort. I thought he was scratching or rubbing it, but now I think his big yawns are pulling on the incision.  Anyway, he's still staying inside (after about 4 hours of outdoor happiness). I can't wait for him to go out and be King Buddy again.
