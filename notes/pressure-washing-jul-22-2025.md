I heard there are video games like Pressure Washing Simulator, where the object is to pretend you're pressure washing things. Maybe there are hazards ("Oops, you pressure washed your sneaker! Lose four toes and miss two turns") that's all there is to it.

Well, I watched this guy pressure wash the house behind me and now I get it. It looks so satisfying! If he'd said "you wanna take over and finish the job?" I might have done it.

Sorry I didn't get a better picture, I'd have had to ask him to pose.
