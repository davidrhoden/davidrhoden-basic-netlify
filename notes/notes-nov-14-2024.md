Never put the home country island in your mouth. There is a cold space such as an unused biological quality and promotion. It is spacious because it is thought of Ashina and Mete. Please give me a lot of time and a lot of things. Manori Station and, receive. Please refrain from eating like a wind, such as putting it on. Again. Do not remove seeds, etc. from the movable part. Please use light. Please do not spend food on the book or receive something you love. Choya Skayan Food. It will be a study of the squid. If there is a good story, please use thinner paint. Please pour water on me.

An article about a letter sent to VP Harris about reasons to ask for a recount. (Mainly that a lot of people have copies of the software that maybe shouldn't.)
The article contains a PDF of the letter laying out the reasoning.

"A group of computer security experts have written to Vice President Kamala Harris to alert her to the fact that voting systems were breached by Trump allies in 2021 and 2022 and to urge her to seek recounts in key states to ensure election verification."

I want a recount because I don't believe that many people voted for Trump from the groups he claims to have made inroads with.

Also, I work with software. It's...fallible.

I listened to a little NPR today, but I don't think I can take All Things Considered seriously anymore. They're just doing the work of making their Democratic listeners feel bad about the Democratic loss (that I don't think was a loss, really). The failed so badly at predicting, I don't know why we should listen to their post-mortems.

I saw some of our local news and that seemed better. All they had to do to make a salient political point do was show footage of RFK Jr, looking dark green and sounding near death, talking about how we're poisoned by fluoride and bemoaning the terrible things Americans eat. Like roadkill, I guess.
