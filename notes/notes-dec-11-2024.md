I sent an email to Norfolk Southern Railroad today to ask them about this project they are planning in my neighborhood. Look up "lower ninth ward grain train" if you want the big story; I can't type it all here. I'm not as _gung ho_ to stop this project as the other protestors. I like to see railroad track in use. But I'm sad that they want to destroy part of the Delery Playground to make room for new track. The playground is one of the few nice things the Lower Ninth Ward community has, and it's also one block from my house.

Here, below, are the images they sent out explaining their plans. The red lines indicate new track, some of which, it appears, is going to go in our playground.
They've avoided talking about this detail and I think they need to start.

Also noted: Eric from Goner Records sent this around, so, thanks to him for catching it. I saw The Fall just once, on Brooklyn, with the line up from this video. I don't think this is the same show, because M.E.S. had black leather gloves on at the show I saw. But the show I saw was a lot like this one! Anyway, this was like reliving that show, only much better.

The Fall, "Blindness":

Ariel and I were discussing _foie gras_ when it came time to box up the (always plentiful) leftovers at Secret Thai.
