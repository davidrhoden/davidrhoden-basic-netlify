I got some Masonite (I think that's what it's called? It's like a clipboard on one side but slightly fuzzy on the other.) I cut some pieces to cover the holes I cut in it to move the electronics around. FOr a guitar that was basically in the trash it's starting to look like an instrument somebody cares about. It sounds really good with the P-90s I put in.
