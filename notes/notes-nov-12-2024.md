Today's weather in New Orleans (cool and rainy) reminds me of Christmas Day 1977 or 1978. When I was old enough to notice patterns in weather on Christmas.

And then I got in a conversation about _gachapon_, which are stores in Japan (mostly) that are just full of vending machines that sell absurd little plastic toys: kittens wrapped up like sushi, keyrings that look like ramen packages, I even saw one that sold tiny plastic vending machines.

I like how these stores acknowledge the pleasure of buying (buying anything) and the pleasures of fandom, AND the pleasure of creating nonsense! Can you imagine if your job was to design these toys??

I know this puts me in the position of certifiably crazy, but I think the vote count was tampered with.
I don't think ten million voters took a pass on this election. There was way too much enthusiasm for Harris, and no prior reporting that people were planning to stay home.
Basically, I don't believe the country is as bad a place as these results make it appear.

I don't know anything about how the votes are really counted, I don't know what software, but I know they are electronic, not paper, and they move from place to place.
Russians are great at interfering in our elections and they're committed to it, plus now you have Musk wanting to control the President as well.
And with all the little hints Trump dropped about "we have the votes, you don't need to vote; Speaker Johnson and I have a little secret, don't we"...
DJT just seems like the guy who would gloat about cheating, especially if Russia forced the cheating on him. He'd want to take credit for it.

But AFAIK the votes never go on the internet, so that rules out Russians hacking machines online. I still feel like the tabulation software is compromised in some way.
I guess they* might do an audit (a recount would be kind of meaningless), but it would make Fox News's armchair warriors, and actual kooks with loaded guns, so angry if they did.

Anyway, I'm not going to foam at the mouth about it, but I just don't believe the country wanted this.
I am probably wrong. Still, I think I'm going to approach the next four years as though rather than a free and fair election, we had a Russian-backed coup.
Even if it was a free and fair election, I don't like the results of it, so I would probably act that way anyway.


\*they: the Biden administration, working with some outside company that's not Dominion, but exactly who is qualified, I don't know. Maybe the software is different for different states. It probably is.
