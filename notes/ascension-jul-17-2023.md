This was something I had been waiting for and expecting, but it was jarring and hard to understand at the same time. We actually got no warning. I can't rmeember if it was Pop's wife or my brother or sister telling me that Pop had finally had to move out of his house.

I just noted it down. I must have been on the phone a little while, to explain the additional drawing. It seems like huge news now but that day it just felt like a little thing.
