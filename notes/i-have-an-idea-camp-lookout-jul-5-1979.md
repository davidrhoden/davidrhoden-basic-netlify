When I went to Camp Lookout, there was a kid named Ronnie with a huge “how-is-babby-formed" forehead. Very slow on the uptake.
One of the crafts at camp was making banners. As you may know, Methodists have a pretty good history of featuring graphically strong felt/fabric banners as part of the worship experience.
I guess they hoped we’d move that craft forward a little bit.
Anyway, Ronnie made a banner with a yellow lightbulb shape. The banner read, in cut-out felt letters, I HAVE AN IDEA.
Even our counselor scornfully repeated this phrase. “I HAVE AN IDEA! That’s great, Ronnie! That’s awesome.”
We were unkind about it.
Later in life, Bev mentioned she met a guy named Ronnie, and it was definitely this guy, and that he asked about me.
