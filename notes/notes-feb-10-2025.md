I turned on the Super Bowl about a half-hour late, but when I did the television was showing an ad for an oil company, bragging about how they plan to do a lot of drilling in the "Gulf of America", and I was so disgusted I turned it off again. I used the time I suddenly got back to make a whole new website for my web design and development business, Happening Interactive.

Here's what the homepage looks like on a desktop computer:

I have enough work I think, but I feel like I should have some more in case President Nazi somehow cuts off the funding to my current job (it's part of a University of California library, just the kind of thing he'd like to get rid of.)
