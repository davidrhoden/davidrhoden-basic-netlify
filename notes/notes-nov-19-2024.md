I'd sorta forgotten about this great tune, "Lives of the Saints, no. 135" by Honor Role. I got a copy of _Human Music_ a Homestead Records 2LP compilation I had, maybe in high school, but got rid of somewhere along the way. I don't think this is my copy. (It has a cut corner and no initials n the inside of the jacket, as was my mark back then.)

Honor Role were from Richmond, Virginia. They didn't fit any genre too well, but you hafta remember they were before Dinosaur, before Jesus Lizard, etc. I also had their album _Rictus_ which was a gloomy, tough listen but also very good. The singer, Bob Schick, sounded like he was getting strangled a lot. Like he was saying something people didn't want to hear. Maybe they didn't. I don't know if you could consider tham a "success" or "popular" other than on their own terms, and among people who thought they were just great.

Here's a live show of Honor Role from C.B.G.B. in 1986.

I am enjoying _Reservation Dogs_. I'm on to Season 2. I had to watch a couple episodes after finishing Lars von Trier's depressing movie _Nymphomaniac Part 1_.

I still don't believe the election results. Just quietly joining the conspiracy theories while I can. Today's cool link:
