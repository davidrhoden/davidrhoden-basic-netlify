In other Dave Rhoden news, I compiled a little booklet of my _karaoke_ cartoons that you may have already seen on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thedavidrhoden/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/davidrhoden/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/davidrhoden).

THey're just drawings of people singing karaoke songs into a home karaoke-type machine. Your job is to I.D. the songs from the quoted excerpts. (There's an answer key on the back cover.)

It's 24 pages, staple-bound. Laser printed on, let's see... 20lb copy paper. Good stuff. It's black-and-white, but so are the originals.

I'd love to send you one. If you want one, just email me your mailing address. If you want to get money involved, you can Venmo me an amount not to exceed four dollars at [@davidrhoden](https://venmo.com/u/davidrhoden). (If you're curious, the minimum transaction on Venmo is $0.01. And a "FOREVER" postage stamp costs 68 cents these days, did you know that? I was shocked.)
