My friend Rel Farrar sent me this, and I am O.K. with saying I didn't read the editorial highlighted here because: what a stupid idea. Thanks again the _The New York Times_, who, in their eternal search to find the middlest of middle grounds on things that actually matter, found someone to recommend that we welcome our new insect overlords (i.e., the fascists).

You wanna know how to avoid spurious political prosecutions? If I were the President I would simply not do any crimes, making it difficult to prosecute me without looking like a bunch of desperate assholes.

NPR Watch: I listened to a few minutes of _All Things Considered_. Ari Shapiro editorialized that the choice of Gaetz for AG was "surprising", to which I say: really? You're surprised? O.K., man. We all knew you did a poor job reporting on the election before Election Day; why change now? Are you being sarcastic? It doesn't work on the radio.

Then he had a guy on who claimed Gaetz has a lot of friends on the Democratic side because they think "he's a fun guy to hang out with".

You know how Ken dolls' clothes kind of fit weird, because the fabric was so thick and polyester-y? I saw that fit on a person on _Columbo_. He looked like a walking Ken doll.

Can y'all even keep up with the amount of accounts in your Facebook feed you have to block? I liked a vegan recipe (I guess) and the next day there were dozens of vegan groups shoving recipes in my carnivorous face.
