I've had two songs stuck in my head all day: "Big Shot" and The Camp Lookout Theme Song.

Let me see how much of it I can really remember....


_Camp Lookout Theme Song_

Out in the woods, with the scorpions and lizards
Where the snakes are so bad, you check your bed each night
Cornstalk Man roams after sundown
So you never go out alone without a light.

Boom boom boom, CAAAAMP Lookout! (LOOKOUT!) The place I want to be!
Boom boom boom, CAAAAMP Lookout! (LOOKOUT!) I never want to leave.

Rain starts to fall as we walk out of the pool (Aww!)
But What's the use, since we're already wet?
_Something something something something
Something something something something_ is the best you'll ever get.

Boom boom boom, CAAAAMP Lookout! (LOOKOUT!) The place I want to be!
Boom boom boom, CAAAAMP Lookout! (LOOKOUT!) I never want to leave.

_Something something something something
Something something something something something_
Rat-infested Lundy Cabin, where we stick the life guard
And the mountaintop is our great big backyard.

I love "Wonderful Christmastime" and I look forward to hearing it a few times every year.
