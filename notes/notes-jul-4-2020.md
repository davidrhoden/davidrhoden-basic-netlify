![Milton Glaser: Lightnin' cover](/static/img/notes/milton-glaser-lightnin.jpg "Milton Glaser: Lightnin' cover")

Milton Glaser died last week on his 91st birthday. I love his illustration style. I bought this Lightnin' Hopkins record mostly for the cover. The record is a really really clean recording of Hopkins; not his greatest performances but they're very well miked.

I got a new television to replace the one that was [stolen](/timeline/i-got-robbed-probably-by-some-shady-women/), and I've been playing GTA IV again, or trying to. I can't drive the damn cars! I keep pushing the stick forward, which changes the camera view for some reason. This seems like a problem with the game and not me. If you know how to get around this, can you [get in touch with me](mailto:david@davidrhoden.com)?

I'm really leaning more toward the idea of the website as document store, especially for small things, or important things. Most sites don't need a database. Not the kind of sites I work on anyway. Simpler content and a simpler aesthetic is what I'm striving for, though the less simple the content, the simpler the aesthetic needs to be.

I'm a big fan of [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), especially when hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This site is an example.
