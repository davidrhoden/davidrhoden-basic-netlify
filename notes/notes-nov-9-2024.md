“Doxidan, gentle Doxidan” appeared in my head upon waking like I heard it yesterday. Why does my brain store this stuff?

The comments on this are funny and relatable.

I know it's ridiculous to say it, but I don't believe the election results. Sorry. I don't think people believed Trump's bullshit enough that FIfTEEN MILLION of them who voted for Biden stayed home. I know I life in a self-created bubble where I don't hear a lot of right-wing propaganda, and maybe I should start listening to it so I'm not so surprised when the votes come in.

But I really want to know more about how the votes are counted. How do we really know what happens the the electronic files between the ballot box and the counters and the final tally sent to....I'm sorry, I don't know where it goes. Is there a Federal master of elections? If so, who is she or he?

I wish the "I Voted" stickers included a copy of your paper ballot. I just feel like the vote count was tampered with. I'm not going to turn into a crank over it, I assure you. Now that people are starting to say, "well, OK, I was wrong, this country is a terrible place": no, I don't think it is. I really think there are more people against Trump than are for him. I think he's a thief; I think Elon wants to be our President and he's pretty confident he can take the office from Vladimir Putin. I wish I knew what happened to the votes.

Laugh at me; it's fine.

If you get those Cold Brew shot dispensers from the grocery store, don't toss them when they're empty. I refill mine with coffee I didn't finish, they're perfect for that. (Maybe this is a just a New Orleans product? It has _fleurs-de-lis_ on it.)

Actually, this is my first time doing that. I might get poisoned. I'll let you know.

I did re-activate my Twitter, [davidrhoden](https://twitter.com/davidrhoden). Feel free to follow me but I don't expect to post there any more.
You can follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/davidrhoden.bsky.social), which is more fun, if you're having a hard time withdrawing from the connection and frequent humor involved being online.

I played the Strikle instead of the Wordle yesterday. If you didn't know, the tech workers at the NYT (the paper that shall not be named) have a union, and they are striking for better terms of employment. They've asked the public to disengage from NYT Games (hard to do) and NYT Cooking (so easy I forgot I did it).

I wish they would just do a rogue Wordle, though I reckon there are a hundred trademark reasons they didn't. But they did create Strikle, and at risk of giving out a spoiler, here's yesterday's:
