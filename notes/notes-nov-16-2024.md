I swiped this scary picture from _The New Republic_. I thought it deserved a wider audience.

I got a trial subscription the _The New Yorker_ and didn't cancel in time, meaning I just got a regular one year subscription. And that means I have a stack of about fifty untouched issues in a pile. When you live in Louisiana you start to notice how much of _The New Yorker_'s content is about restaurants and plays that happen in New York.

But I was pleased to grab a fresh issue from the stack, this one being Jan. 1 & 8, 2024. Inside was a treat: a new short story, "Hi Daddy", by Matthew Klam. Klam is one of my favorite contemporary writers. He's great at narrating believable internal monologues for his main characters, who are all men, if I recall correctly. (So this little note may only be of interest to those who are interested in the internal monologues/thinking of men. I'll try to write something else at another time.) Anyway, he describes life really well. It's a combination of plot and thought that is seamless, or at least I don't notice the seams. Now thiat I think about it, trying to describe it, I realize it's pretty complex, the way the story shifts in place and time. It seems to start in the present, but then it's revealed that the beginning was a flashback, maybe? It probably doesn't sound good when I describe it like that but It's cool effect that doesn't get in the way of the mood of the story.

I don't want to try to write a review or an essay about it now. I just really liked it. I think Klam is so good at describing people and their behavior in a way I recognize from how my own mind works, and how my own internal monologue sounds.

Why are they saying there was no enthusiasm for Kamala Harris when her campaign brought in such large amounts of money? Was it all big donors?
Why did the media take on her switch so immediately? People were absolutely excited about her candidacy. The news told us they were, didn't they?

I don't understand why Republicans have a problem with Matt Gaetz over the underage prostitutes when his ideas and political positions are also bad.
