I'm doing all right, despite the pandemic. I am okay not seeing too many people. Saving money, I guess.
I'm getting better at Grand Theft Auto IV. Still can't finish the mission "Hung Out To Dry" but I've been taking a lot of cab fares, so I'm getting better at driving and changing the radio station without thinking.
