## I make a living from other peoples' difficulties 

July 6, 2020

I used to work at a world-famous branding firm where all our site were Internet Explorer 6 first. meaning that was the browser we had to target first, before making the sites work on more modern, frankly _better_ browsers. We all hated working that way. But then I realized "thanks to Microsoft's bad decisions and market share, I can command a much higher price for my work, because nobody else wants to bother with this trash. So thanks, Mr. Gates."

I still get frustrated working on drag-and-drop Wordpress sites and stuff like that, but I have to remember: if people didn't rely so much on these hard-to-operate systems they might not need me anymore. It's kind of hard to keep billing for something if you built it right the first time.

I will immediately add that I don't work that way when it's up to me. I love building for simplicity and ease of use, and client satisfaction. (that's why my site looks like it does: no "bells and whistles". Just _content_.) But I'm trying to also enjoy working on the sites that have complexity for the sake of complexity. They're good for my bank account.
