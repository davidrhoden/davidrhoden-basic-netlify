excerpt: My privacy policy is simple. I do not share or sell my mailing list; I have never done so, and I will not do so in the future. It would bum me out to do that. You can always have your information removed from my list by asking me or by using the Buttondown Unsubscribe link.

# Privacy Policy

I collect personally identifiable data on this site through forms, such as my Buttondown mailing list sign-up form or my form I ask you to fill out if you're interested in working with me. I may at times have other forms or pages that ask site users to provide information like e-mail addresses or postal addresses so I can get in touch with them or ship them things.

My privacy policy is simple. I do not share or sell my mailing list; I have never done so, and I will not do so in the future. It would bum me out to do that. You can always have your information removed from my list by asking me or by using the Buttondown Unsubscribe link.

If you have questions about my privacy policy or how I use data you have shared with me, please email me at david@davidrhoden.com.
